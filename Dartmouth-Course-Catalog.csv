African and African-American Studies,AAAS,11,Introduction to African Studies,"This course introduces a global socio-historical framework within which to examine Africa in relation to multiple African Diasporas and notions of mobility. Considering the historical contexts of contact between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, we examine cultural, economic, and philosophic aspects of Africa. We will examine how ideas of what it means to be African culturally, racially, and politically are continually produced and contested. The moment of independence of many African nation-states from European colonial rule in the mid 20th century operates as a centering point from which we will examine economics, race, politics, and artistic expressions. We will consider ideas of “tradition” and “modernity,” representations of Africa, more recent processes of commodification, as well as various cultural and political responses to them.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-11

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,16,"History, Culture and Society: The Many Faces of Latin America","The Spanish discovery and conquest of this continent created Latin America and the Caribbean out of the diverse and complex realities of the pre-Columbian world. Since colonial times Latin American and Caribbean cultures have developed against a background of cultural repression, racial conflict, political domination, colonial exploitation, and gender inequality. And yet, in the midst of all this turmoil, Latin America and the Caribbean have produced an extraordinary variety and wealth of artistic creations, ranging from literature to the visual arts, from music to film. In this course we will turn to some of the works by Latin American and Caribbean artists and writers in an attempt to illuminate and explore some of the wonders of the cultural dynamics that shape the many faces of what we call Latin America and the Caribbean.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-16

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,20.50,"Lest We Forget: History, Collective Memory and Slavery at Dartmouth","Beyond noting that Wheelock owned slaves, little is known of Dartmouth's other historical connections, if any, to the institution of slavery.   This research seminar investigates the college's economic entanglement in the trade and slaveholding; as a site for the intellectual legitimation and contestation of slavery; and the contributions of enslaved persons to its development. We will also review the origins, findings and responses to similar collective memory projects at other institutions including Brown, Emory and Yale.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-20-50
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,21,Racial Justice,"This course introduces students to major contemporary racial justice debates. It also considers how theories of racial justice might better include the concerns of women of color as well as LGBT and trans persons of color. Throughout the course we will examine questions such as: What constitutes racial injustice? How is gender implicated in said injustice? What, if anything, do blacks and other people of color owe to one another? Should political possibility and pragmatism bound thinking regarding corrective racial justice?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-21

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,22.10,African American Religion and Culture in Jim Crow America,"Jim Crow segregation in the United States compelled many African American men and women to use their bodies—their hands, feet, and voices—to create sacred scenes, sounds, and spaces to articulate their existence in America. This seminar focuses on religious production to explore African American culture in the post-Civil War era. Students will analyze a variety of sources, including music, visual art, film, religious architecture, sermons, food, theater, photography, and news media.

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,22.50,Islam in America,"Muslim Ban? Malcolm X? Enslaved Muslims? Hijab? This course is about Muslims in America, past, present, and future, and how American Islam is an extension of global Islam and the ways it is uniquely American. As we study religious identity and understandings of Islam in enslaved Muslim narratives, the civil rights movement, waves of immigration, pre- and post- 9/11, and the current Muslim ban, we pay close attention to theorizations of contested histories, race, gender, and class dynamics, intersectionality, model minorityhood, assimilation, discrimination, and Malcolm X’s visit to Dartmouth College, the history and the significance of the Malcolm X murals in the Shabazz building.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-22-50
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,23,The Black Sporting Experience,"This course examines the historical and contemporary sporting experiences primarily of Black Americans. The decision to refer to this class as a “Black” experience is deliberate, as we will briefly interrogate how race and sports functions for the Black diaspora in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe. Despite brief examinations of the diaspora, this class uses sports history as a critical lens to understand American history.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-23
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,24,The Black Radical Tradition in America,"This course introduces major currents in the history of black radical thought, with a particular focus on the U.S. after emancipation. This class encourages students to define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of various liberation struggles. By exploring dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship and freedom as expressed through nonviolence, armed rebellion, black nationalism, Pan Africanism, socialism, communism, anticolonialism, feminism, queer theory and integrationism, students will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-24
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,24.50,Contemporary Black Political Thought and the Modern World,"In the era and “return” of mass political social movements, the question is perhaps not what is the most urgent political struggle of today; rather, what remains unheard, unseen, and unthought in the struggle for political freedom? This course seeks to familiarize students with the works of contemporary black political thinkers who have contributed to the rich theoretical developments and productive tensions in Black Studies, discourses on black resistance and freedom struggle, and political action itself. The course focuses on several key concepts—such as civic and social death, sovereignty, the collective unconscious, the radical imagination—as a way to examine notions of agency and the psychic life of racial violence, particularly in the context of the United States. What is the dream-work of Black freedom? And how do dreams of (black) freedom become realized and/or barred from larger socio-political, economic, and legal structures to the more abstract registers of language, aesthetics, culture, and the imagination? The course investigates the theoretical tenets within contemporary Black Studies as critical theory, arguing that these are equally contributive to the continental philosophical tradition on questions of life, rights, civil society, and personhood.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-24-50
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,25,Constructing Black Womanhood,"This course is a critical examination of the historical and contemporary status of black women in the United States, as presented in fiction, primary accounts, and social science literature. We will explore the nature, extent, and consequences of the multiple discriminations of race, sex, and class, as the context in which these women shaped their social roles and identities within the black community and the larger society. We will consider the themes of family, motherhood, and sexuality; educational, economic and political participation; aesthetics and religious traditions; self and social images.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-25
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,26,Toni Morrison,"This course is an in-depth study of Toni Morrison’s major fictional works. We will also read critical responses by and about the author. We will examine Morrison’s earliest and arguably most foundational and influential works. Required texts will include, The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, A Mercy, and Conversations with Toni Morrison. Central to our exploration will be an analysis of Morrison’s observation that “the past affects the present.” Therefore, we will explore the social and historical factors that contribute to Morrison’s artistic constructions. Some of the issues we will examine include, alternative constructions offemale community and genealogy, and representations of race, class, nationhood, and identity.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-26
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,27,Transformative Spiritual Journeys. Contemporary Memoirs of African American Religion,"This course presents African Americans who have created religious and spiritual lives amid the variety of possibilities for religious belonging in the second half of the twentieth century and the early twenty-first century. By engaging an emerging canon of autobiographies, we will take seriously the writings of theologians, religious laity, spiritual gurus, hip hop philosophers, LGBT clergy, religious minorities, and scholars of religion as foundational for considering contemporary religious authority through popular and/or institutional forms of African American religious leadership. Themes of spiritual formation and religious belonging as a process—healing, self-making, writing, growing up, renouncing, dreaming, and liberating—characterize the religious journeys of the African American writers, thinkers, and leaders whose works we will examine. Each weekly session will also incorporate relevant audiovisual religious media, including online exhibits, documentary films, recorded sermons, tv series, performance art, and music.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-27

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,31.10,"Dance Theatre of Harlem Workshop: The Hazel Scott Project, Artist as Activist.","Synthesizing aspects of cultural storytelling, theater, movement, activism and biography, this course is focused on the creation of new performance work. Students will have a rare opportunity to engage with the singular Dance Theatre of Harlem (DTH) during their summer residency at Dartmouth College as they begin original choreography of a performance work inspired by the legendary entertainer Hazel Scott.

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,31.50,Black Theatre Workshop: The August Wilson Experience,"Using legendary playwright, August Wilson’s ten-play cycle of African Americans' experiences throughout American history as our inspiration, this course provides hands-on, experiential learning of acting, script analysis, and theatrical production. With no previous performance, design, or production experience required, students will read Wilson’s plays and related commentary with opportunities to perform selected scenes from the Wilson cycle while exploring possibilities for design and technical elements. In this process-oriented course, students also learn basic acting techniques by strengthening observation and listening skills, risktaking, imagination, improvisation, concentration, exploration of self, voice, and body. Activities include textual analysis of Wilson’s plays and related works as well as documenting and revising performance philosophy and process. While providing a safe space for exploring the roles we play in our daily lives and taking on the roles of others in given or imagined circumstances,students will learn widely accepted theories, practices, and terminology of the actor’s craft in order to facilitate the practice, writing, and discussion of acting and producing Wilson’s plays and others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-31-50
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,32.01,Race and Gender in American Film,"This course is an introduction to the history of race and gender in American film. These fundamental social constructs in American life have been central to the development of American film narrative from the beginnings of cinema at the turn of the twentieth century. In turn, American films have profoundly shaped the ways that we think about race and gender and racialized and gendered beings. We will analyze the shifting and situational meanings of race and gender throughout the twentieth century, and in particular, how they have been influenced by the forces of history, including wars, economic depressions, and social movements. While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the “golden age”, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present. In our consideration of race and racialized peoples, we will include African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos. Our discussions of gender will be expansive to include not just women and femininity, but men and masculinity as well.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-32-01
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,32.02,Black Queer Literature and Film,"This seminar will combine elements of black (trans) feminist theory and black queer theory to examine the written works and films/videos by and about lesbians, bisexual, transgender, gay and queer Black people.  Emphasis will be on tracing the emergence of black literary and cinematic voices from the late twentieth century to the present. We will read poetry, fiction and essays as well as watch films with an eye towards  understanding the historical and theoretical construction of sexual and gender identities, politics and sexual/cultural practices in Black communities. Special attention will be paid to the construction of race, gender and sexual identities in North America, the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-32-02
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,32.15,The Making of 21st Century Exhibits: Curating a National Black Theater Museum/Institution,"This course is designed for those interested in theatre and performance, African American studies, history, and culture. Students will study influences on the development of black theater and performance in the USA as well as processes for preserving, curating, and exhibiting culture in institutions, examining how museum concepts intersect and/or collide with representations of black history and culture. In collaboration with the Hattiloo Theatre in Memphis and the DeVos Institute of Arts Management, who are drafting plans for an institution devoted to black theatre practitioners, students will determine and develop content for an interactive venue. They will consider strategies for the use of technology and live exhibits, involving black communities in exhibits and curation, and providing access to diverse communities. Projects and findings will be shared with the institution’s developers and will be considered in their ongoing plans. The course will include a visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,32.50,Black LGBTQ History,"This course is an introduction to the study of Black LGBTQ history in the United States. We will examine a range of primary and secondary source material from the nineteenth century through the late twentieth century. This material includes documentaries, scholarship, newspaper articles, newsletters, diaries and letters. We will look at sexual relationships in the nineteenth century among slaves and free people as well as the cultures of sexual diversity and gender transgression a couple of generations after slavery that gave rise to the jazz age and the Harlem Renaissance. We will also take a look at post-war America, the Civil Rights and Black Power era for their moments of sexual expression and gender variance as well as repression. The course will continue to examine Black experience into the AIDS crisis, gay marriage debates and transgender rights movements.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-32-50
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,33.10,Rituals of Breath: Black Performance and Resistance,"This interdisciplinary course explores the historical legacy of public rituals of extreme violence against African American peoples as both sites of anti-black state and non-state sanctioned disciplinary projects as well as time-spaces of radical resistance. From the slave trade to life and labor under conditions of slavery to post-reconstruction segregation to lynching to police violence, American history can be read through the changing nature of the public torture of Black peoples. At the center of these forms of violence are the control of breath as life force and sign of freedom. This course examines the murder of Eric Garner in 2014 in a police-executed choke hold as a key event that both harkens back to a long history of lynchings and shootings and also to a history of how Black communities have organized around and resisted these forms of violence. Aesthetic representation has been intimately connected to anti-Black racial violence from photographs and postcards of lynchings in which white perpetrators pose alongside dead Black bodies to representations of Emmitt Till’s mutilated body at his funeral in an open casket to video of Rodney King’s beating to the continuing stream of video and images of extra-judicial killings of black citizens. Generations of artists in film, theater, painting/sculpture, dance, and across media have challenged and confronted this aesthetics of violence. This course explores theories of ritual and performance to understand how artists and communities come together as collectives to contextualize and re-present impossible terrors. Artists and political organizers use aesthetics and collective action to transform the horror of being subject to violence at any moment into rituals of potential social transformation. This course then teaches students theories of ritual and performance as ways that communities have historically engaged and confronted histories of anti-Black violences in order to conceive of new future possibilities in the face of disciplinary actions meant to contain and choke black people(s). In some manner, the course links African American experiences of violence and resistance to those of other African peoples around the world. This course is team taught and also draws upon the expertise of various faculty at Dartmouth. This course aims to link theories of Black life and performance to active practices of performance-making, interrogating the intersections between art and scholarship.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-33-10

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,35.50,Introduction to  African American Environmental Thought: The Black Outdoors,"The persistence of black life, and blackness as a way of thinking about the organization of both human and nonhuman forms of life, has been absolutely central to the story of the United States and the Americas more broadly. This course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the writing of thinkers from across the African diaspora, with special emphasis on literary works and criticism centrally concerned with the intersections of black literary studies and African American environmental thought. We will draw on a range of texts in order to wrestle with some of the key concerns of African American writers from the 19th century through the present. Students will be introducedto a range of methods and approaches to the meta-disciplinary work of black literary studies. By the end of the course, students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of several major themes, figures and moments within the black expressive tradition.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-35-50
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,36.50,Rasta and Rastafari,"This course examines the Rastafari spiritual and political movement from its genesis in Jamaica to its transformation into a global phenomenon. Today’s perception of Rastafari is informed by popular images of marijuana smoking, reggae musicians and a laid-back lifestyle. Consequently, Rasta is often mistaken for practicing a countercultural phenomenon of no global significance, a poster child for the undesirable other, or merely a misguided rebel. Rastafari however, is significantly more profound. Rastafari has offered, cloaked in revolutionary black hermeneutics, some of the sharpest critiques against European imperialism and exploitation. Despite the presence of burgeoning scholarship, Rasta’s global significance remains hidden in the fissures of most historical discourses and behind the haze of marijuana smoke created by popular understandings of the movement. This course employs monographs, scholarly articles, documentary films and primary sources and music to and explore Rastafarian ideologies that among other things, promoted decolonization while decrying racism and imperialism. It is open to students seeking to broaden their knowledge of religions and socio-political movements in the African diaspora.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-36-50

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,62.50,Maroons to Marley: Jamaica's Role in Worldwide Revolutions from Slavery to the Present Day,"In 1738, a hundred years before legal emancipation came to England’s New World slave colonies, Jamaica’s Maroons forced the colonial power to sign a treaty granting sovereignty to Maroon communities across the Caribbean island. As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment. This course traces the impact of “Jamaican” revolutionary figures on other revolutionary figures and events worldwide. Moving chronologically, from colonialism to the present day, the course examines influences such as African/Jamaican Maroon leaders direct impact on other revolutions throughout the Americas; Mary Seacole’s exchanges with and impact on Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; Marcus Garvey’s impact on the Harlem Renaissance and the Rastafari religion; Claude McKay’s revolutionary impact on vernacular poetics and on the “Red Scare;” Louise Bennett’s mid-twentieth century revolutionary, feminist, vernacular poetics and her impact on female performers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa; Bob Marley and Damian Marley’s impact on politics and revolutionary movements in Liberia and Ghana; and finally, the impact of Staceyann Chin’s outspoken poetics on LGBTQ rights in the Caribbean and in other marginalized African diasporic communities.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-62-50

How has science shaped our understanding of race and human diversity? This course explores how and why race is a social construction with profound implications in our social world not only in the U.S. but also beyond its shores. Diverse sciences have established that human beings are well over 99% genetically identical, but race remains a potent vision through division that has been made and made to matter across multiple spheres of life.

The contexts of the colonial encounter and its postcolonial aftermath will set the stage for our examination of the ways in which social, political, economic, and cultural factors foster the production of specific masculinities. Texts include Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Lafferiere's How to Make Love to a Negro, and additional writings by Irish, Indian, and Aus­tralian authors.

Drawing on archival research, critical theory and speculative fiction from Black queer and trans thinkers such as Miss Major, Edouard Glissant, Marie Vieux-Chauvet, Octavia Butler, and Samuel Delany, our goal will be to challenge our current carceral order, chart how we move past it, and imagine what liberatory prison abolitionist futures lie beyond.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-67-80

This narrative is one that continues to ignore the African presence, now on French soil for centuries, as does it consider its Black and Muslim citizens as second-class. Moreover, to French society, racism became an opinion rather than an ideology and the colonial past a forgotten chapter with the collapse of the French colonial empire in 1962 at the end of the war in Algeria. Yet, reports and studies from governmental and non-governmental antiracism associations document and denounce the existence of racial discrimination and racism in everyday life, which echo past representations and practices. Indeed, social and cultural movements continue to question silences on the colonial past and how it facilitates anti-Black racism. In this course, we will explore how the coloniality of republican power – the ways in which processes of racialization continue to operate and to create spaces of greater vulnerability – are rooted in a historical context of slavery that continues to operate after 1962 as well as the counter-narratives and cartographies that have emerged in response.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-68-10

Is mass incarceration an inevitable product of slavery and Jim Crow? Why has prison expansion and law and order been a rallying cry make America safe (again) precisely at moments when violent crime rates were going down?
This course is designed to explore and explain the role of surveillance, criminalization, policing to historical and contemporary US state formation and global racial capitalism. This course proceeds from the idea that carceral geographies such as prison towns, detention centers, police departments, welfare agencies, and surveillance apparatuses are spatial fixes for social, economic, and political crises. We will engage scholarship from critical prison studies, geography, gender and sexuality studies, and critical ethnic studies to understand the different dimensions and question that emerge from thinking about space, race, gender, sexuality, land, labor, and state capacity together. Students will have an opportunity to build their understanding of the historical and contemporary organization of people, places, ideas and infrastructure that makes up US carceral geographies. Student will also have a chance to familiarize themselves with the history of resistance to penal democracy. This course requires dedicated and rigorous reading.

The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice around the country. The Black Arts Movement had far-reaching implications for the way artists and writers think about race, history, authorship, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. We'll explore these issues in work by Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others who forged the traditionally-defined Black Arts Movement in Harlem. We'll also trace the movement's flowering around country, where local political struggles and artistic traditions in Chicago, Newark, Los Angeles, and Detroit shaped distinctive regional variations of the Black Arts Movement.

Students study the causes of this invisibility and social isolation (mainly pertaining to incarceration and addiction) by participating in an interdisciplinary arts program with local community members from these invisible populations while at the same time attending discussion-based seminars.

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,81.10,James Baldwin: From the Civil Rights Movement to Black Lives Matter,"The 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro encourages a new generation to explore the life and work of James Baldwin (1924–1987). Directed by Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck, I Am Not Your Negro is a provocative documentary that envisions a book Baldwin never finished by providing insight into Baldwin’s relationship with three men who were assassinated before their fortieth birthdays—Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr.
In this course we will interrogate questions of race, sexuality, violence, and migration. Our current political moment encourages the examination of these issues while Baldwin’s life and work provides the ideal vantage point for their investigation. Using I Am Not Your Negro as our starting point, Baldwin’s life and work will allow us the opportunity to explore transatlantic discourses on nationality, sexuality, race, gender, and religion. We will also explore the work of other writers including Richard Wright, Frantz Fanon, Audre Lorde, and Ta-Nehisi Coates.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-81-10

These religious systems will be discussed with reference to their mainstream representation (as ""voodoo"") and analyzed according to the more complex realities of their practitioners' everyday lives. Three themes to be explored in each tradition include 1) gender identity; 2) racial identity and resistance; and 3) aesthetics.

These concerns include (but are not limited to) notions of exile, the importance of language and music, the articulation of identity in varying post-colonial states, and representations of gender, race and ethnicity. The class will also analyze the socio-political events in particular nations and the ways in which these events influence writing in the archipelago. We will also examine the ways in which a strong tradition of music as protest influences the production of particular poetic forms in Trinidad and Jamaica. The class will move from early twentieth century writers like Claude McKay to the important contributions of later writers such as Kamau Brathwaite, Jamaica Kincaid, George Lamming, V.S. Naipaul, Sam Selvon, Olive Senior and Derek Walcott. We will examine the more recent innovations in form, as musical elements are introduced by writers such as Mikey Smith and Kwame Dawes.

Over one million African slaves were trafficked to this Caribbean island. With Cuba as our main port of entry, this course introduces students to the history of African diasporic societies and politics in Latin America and the Caribbean from the late colonial period to the twentieth century.

It charts the development and dimensions of artistic expressions and cultural production in Africa from the colonial period to the contemporary. By looking at various case studies comparatively, the course explores the intersection of developments in artistic practice and identity, and cultural production, and sweeping changes in the political, social and economic spheres in Africa.

Instead of presenting a comprehensive survey, covering every aspect of this vast subject, this course takes a topical approach by focusing on a selection of themes and issues that are crucial to developing an understanding of slavery in Ghana and Africa and the slave trade across the Atlantic. Themes to be covered include African and European agency in slavery and slave trade; slavery and slave trade in framing the social structure of Ghana; the legacies of slavery in Ghana and Africa and the ways in which slavery is remembered in Ghana. Throughout the course, we will pay attention to the debilitating effects of slavery and the slave trade on Africa and on its development.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-87-08

This course explores the languages of Africa from a historical, linguistic, and cultural standpoint, including the migration and diffusion of different language groups across the continent, similarities and differences in linguistic structure between African languages, the amazing complexity of the Khoisan languages (best known for their use of clicks), the effects of colonialism on language, writing systems, and many other topics.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-87-11
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,87.12,Africa's Time? An Interdisciplinary Survey of Temporality and Power,"Centered in Africa, this course explores the theme of temporality through attention to history, anthropology, philosophy, and popular theoretical physics. There will be no mathematical calculation required. However, we will consider difficult formulas of another type. Is time a constant across cultures and reference frames both physical and ontological? How do past, present, and future intersect? How has the perception of time influenced historical encounters on the African continent and within the African diaspora? How does time relate to ancestry and power?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-87-12

Drawing on primary sources, film, and literature, we will examine the transnational dialogue among US African Americans, Afro-Latinos, and Afro-Caribbeans from the 19th century to the present. We will also consider why efforts to mobilize Afro-descendants across the Americas have often been undermined by mutual misunderstandings, conflicting agendas, and differing conceptions of ""race"" and ""nation.""",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-07
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,88.08,Ethnography of Violence,"Violence is widely recognized as a problem in modern society, with policies and interventions to combat violence, or employ it, dominating local and global politics. Yet the meaning of violence is seldom analyzed. Using an ethnographic lens, this course explores violence as both an embodied experience and a culturally and politically mediated event. We examine spectacular and everyday violence forms of violence in terms of manifestations of power, structures of inequality, perceptions of difference, and politics of representation. Ethnographic studies are drawn from, among others, Mozambique, Haiti, and Harlem. An introduction to the cultural anthropology of violence, this course raises key questions about violence in a globalized world and explores how to study it anthropologically. This course is not open to students who have received credit for ANTH 12.03.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-08
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,88.11,Atlantic Slavery/Atlantic Freedom,"When does slavery find itself chiasmatically mirrored in freedom? From the recent Hollywood blockbuster 12 Years a Slave (2013) to the streets of Ferguson and Baltimore, the legacies of slavery and racial violence continue to cast their shadow over horizons of emancipationist history even as America commemorates the sesquicentennial of the U.S. Civil War. In this course we will revisit the literatures of slavery and antislavery in the Atlantic world from the eighteenth century to the present. Our novels and stories imagine episodes of slavery, slave rebellion, and fugitive flights to freedom across two centuries: from early transatlantic crossings of slaves and servants to the New World; to Tacky’s Revolt and its place in what Vincent Brown has recently called the “Coromantee Archipelago” in eighteenth century slave rebellion; to the spectacular soundings of the Haiti Revolution in the Age of Revolutions; to the messianic prophecies of Nat Turner in the early nineteenth century; to slave rebellions at sea; and finally to fugitive slave fictions in the abolitionist decade leading up to the Civil War.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-11

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,88.13,Women Writing Memoir,"This course examines the autobiographical writing of a variety of women from across the globe. Paying attention to the socio-political contexts within which these women write, we will discuss the ways in which these authors negotiate different worlds while being marginalized along vectors such as race, class, and gender. For this reason, the class is inherently interdisciplinary. Most of the works we will examine have achieved significant critical acclaim, and we will also examine the artistic innovations in these narratives. Texts will include works such as Staceyann Chinn’s The Other Side of Paradise, Jackie Kay’s Red Dust Road, Jeanette Winterson’s Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?, Malala Yousafzai’s I am Malala, Janet Mock’s Redefining Realness and Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-13

How does Black women’s activism constitute a political intellectual tradition that impacts how we do research and pose questions? How does black women’s activism refigure the categories and categorization of knowledge and knowledge production? What does it mean to write oneself into existence if and when knowledge is premised on their epistemic and actual disappearance? This course approaches Black women’s intellectual and cultural production as one entry point into the project of creating from nothing, writing to become, writing as an act of survival, and writing to envision and practice new worlds.

By taking an socio-historical approach to the idea of rights we will make connections between sovereignty, the rule of law, representational practices, economy, and citizenship. We will use a critical eye to explore the conditions of possibility that allow states, development organizations, donor agencies, and individuals to unwittingly reproduce centuries-old tropes of poverty, degradation, and helplessness of non-Western peoples. Examining various institutionally structured encounters between Europeans and non-Western peoples we unpack assumptions about the naturalness of power. In postcolonial societies the tensions between ideas of tradition and modernity structure many conflicts over rights, citizenship, and the role of the individual in society.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-16

We will learn how to think about and make sounds and images in historically and ethnographically rich ways. In the process we examine notions of power, difference, history, culture, race, class, gender. Twentieth-century politics were intimately linked to the rapid development of radio, television, film, video, and digital media. These media have creatively engaged with local cultural practices around the world in reshaping the nature of artistic expression, national, gendered, and racial difference, and political power. We examine notions of visuality from the perspective of African and African diasporic political configurations and aesthetic responses. This course explores the politics and pragmatics of art, photography, and film in order to delineate visual, sonic, and embodied ways of presenting and experiencing the world particularly in relation to race and gender.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-17

Although combatting racial inequality and white supremacy is generally understood through the lens of movements in the US, or the example of South African apartheid, this course invites students to consider such undertakings from a fundamentally transnational point of view by focusing on Black Feminisms in the French-speaking African diaspora.

Attention will be given to significant artists and movements (Kara Walker, Kyle Baker, Kehinde Wiley, Afro-Futurism, etc.) and to the new conceptualizations in art history brought about by them. Students will gain critical skills of visual literacy as they analyze drawings, paintings, and other visual media, while also learning to ground such observations within aesthetic, cultural, historical, and larger theoretical contexts. Student work will consist of presentations, short papers, and a gallery project, in which students present their own independent research in a collaborative student show.

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,88.20,Music and the Racial Imagination,"This course investigates how the construction, imagination, and lived experience of race has influenced musical production, reception, and analysis. We begin by addressing the history of the concept of race, then turn to a series of musical case studies that variously articulate music’s relationship to the construction and negotiation of racial categories. Topics are primarily drawn from the U.S. and include: Asian American hip hop; the “race record” industry; country music and “whiteness,” amongst others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-88-20

We will focus on a range of cases in Latin America and the U.S. to address the following questions: In what ways does the state create and sustain certain categories of identity as the basis for political inclusion and exclusion? What explains changes in the political salience of certain categories of collective identity? Why do some identities become politically salient and others do not? How have forms of political representation changed over the past century? How does state policy affect the ability of groups to mobilize and press for demands? How do organized groups affect state policy?

We will explore the lives and prophetic careers of people who claimed direct revelation from a supreme being or lesser spirits in indigenous African religions, Islam, and African and African-American Christianity. We will examine such movements before European occupation as well as the colonial and post-colonial eras. We will also examine African-American movements from the period of slavery and the twentieth century. Topics will include women’s prophetic movements, religious critiques of underdevelopment, the process of inculturation of Islam and Christianity, and the role of religion in resistance to foreign or domestic domination.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-90-02

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,90.09,Carceral Geographies: Explaining Mass Incarceration in the US,"Why are there so many people incarcerated in the United States and why are so many people in the US and beyond calling for an end to police violence, some even for the abolition of policing? Is mass incarceration an inevitable product of slavery and Jim Crow? Why did prisons expand in the United States as crime rates were going down? Was it the War on Drugs, or the long term effects of housing discrimination?
This course is designed to explore and explain these questions by unpacking the roles of surveillance, criminalization, policing and incarceration to historical and contemporary US state formation and global capitalism. Proceeding from the idea that carceral geographies such as prison towns, policing, and surveillance are spatial fixes for social, economic, and political crises, we will engage scholarship from a variety of fields including: critical prison studies, geography, cultural studies, gender and sexuality studies, and critical ethnic studies. Students will have an opportunity to understand the historical and contemporary organization of people, places, ideas, and infrastructure that makes up US carceral geographies of the United States. This course requires dedicated and rigorous reading.

Through recent books in the ethnography of Africana religions, spiritual communities in Africa, the Caribbean, and North America that have established communities in the United States will constitute the focus of our course readings and anchor our weekly discussions. As an advanced seminar, our meetings will allow participants to interrogate the authors of these ethnographies. We will assess how these accounts have conceptualized the African diaspora and the vantages (“insiders” and “outsiders”) from which they describe religious beliefs, practices, and institutions. Beyond considering the commonalities and distinctions in form and practice that characterize various African diasporic religious practices, participants will also work to understand the constructions of race and belonging, ethnic identity, gender, sexuality, class, and geographic location that affect the lives of black religious adherents.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-90-10
African and African-American Studies,AAAS,91.02,20th Century Protest Poetry,"In light of recent protest movements that target issues of race and gender, the prescient words of numerous artists continue to be evoked and volleyed about in contemporary media outlets. Yet the contexts of many of these utterances are largely ignored. Delving into some of these contexts and engaging many of these artists’ larger oeuvre, this course is a multidisciplinary investigation of major protest poets of the twentieth century. It explores the ways in which poets living in the United States, and particularly members of historically marginalized communities, not only pushed back at the powers-that-be, but continuously saw and articulated themselves as simultaneously a part of and a part from larger “American” society. The course wrestles with the well-known and often contentious topics: race, class, and gender. Starting with turn-of-the-century writers like Claude McKay—whose words have become synonymous with outspoken critiques of World War I and the “Red Scare”—and ending with contemporary writers like Balakian and Chin, the course moves chronologically. Some of the writers it examines include, Peter Balakian, Amiri Baraka, Staceyann Chin, Lucille Clifton, Mayda Del Valle, Karen Garrabrant, Allen Ginsberg, Zbignew Herbert, Robert Lowell, Juan Felipe Herrera, Langston Hughes, Etheridge Knight, Denise Levertov, Haki Madhubuti, Jill McDonough, Claude McKay, Alice Notley, Emmy Perez, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Sonia Sanchez, and Dorothy Tse.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-91-02

African and African-American Studies,AAAS,91.05,Maroons to Marley: Jamaica's Role in Worldwide Revolutions from Slavery to the Present Day,"In 1738, a hundred years before legal emancipation came to England’s New World slave colonies, Jamaica’s Maroons forced the colonial power to sign a treaty granting sovereignty to Maroon communities across the Caribbean island. As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment. This course traces the impact of “Jamaican” revolutionary figures on other revolutionary figures and events worldwide. Moving chronologically, from colonialism to the present day, the course examines influences such as African/Jamaican Maroon leaders direct impact on other revolutions throughout the Americas; Mary Seacole’s exchanges with and impact on Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; Marcus Garvey’s impact on the Harlem Renaissance and the Rastafari religion; Claude McKay’s revolutionary impact on vernacular poetics and on the “Red Scare;” Louise Bennett’s mid-twentieth century revolutionary, feminist, vernacular poetics and her impact on female performers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa; Bob Marley and Damian Marley’s impact on politics and revolutionary movements in Liberia and Ghana; and finally, the impact of Staceyann Chin’s outspoken poetics on LGBTQ rights in the Caribbean and in other marginalized African diasporic communities.

Anthropology,ANTH,12.23,Introduction to African Studies,"This course introduces a global socio-historical framework within which to examine Africa in relation to multiple African Diasporas and notions of mobility. Considering the historical contexts of contact between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, we examine cultural, economic, and philosophic aspects of Africa. We will examine how ideas of what it means to be African culturally, racially, and politically are continually produced and contested. The moment of independence of many African nation-states from European colonial rule in the mid 20th century operates as a centering point from which we will examine economics, race, politics, and artistic expressions. We will consider ideas of “tradition” and “modernity,” representations of Africa, more recent processes of commodification, as well as various cultural and political responses to them.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-12-23
Anthropology,ANTH,12.24,Africa's Time? An Interdisciplinary Survey of Temporality and Power,"Centered in Africa, this course explores the theme of temporality through attention to history, anthropology, philosophy, and popular theoretical physics. There will be no mathematical calculation required. However, we will consider difficult formulas of another type. Is time a constant across cultures and reference frames both physical and ontological? How do past, present, and future intersect? How has the perception of time influenced historical encounters on the African continent and within the African diaspora? How does time relate to ancestry and power?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-12-24
Anthropology,ANTH,12.26,Environmental Justice,"Around the world, people suffer because of environmental degradation, from sickening industrial pollution to unnatural disasters to disruptive climate change. This course examines how environmental harms are unequally experienced, as well as how communities organize to protect themselves. We will discuss the concept of “environmental justice” as it has developed through social movements in the United States and elsewhere. We will also explore it as an analytical category that (a) explains how inequality manifests environmentally and (b) enables critical thinking about concepts like the “environment” and mainstream environmentalism and environmental policy. Drawing from Anthropology, Geography, History, Sociology, and other disciplines, we will focus on the lived experiences of environment justice and injustice around the world.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-12-26
Anthropology,ANTH,13,Who Owns the Past?,"Modern archaeology grew out of antiquarianism, imperialism, and the attempts of early collectors and scholars to look to the past for aesthetics, to construct identities, and to satisfy their curiosities. This course examines how these legacies influence contemporary archaeology, museum practices, and policies to manage cultural heritage. The central question will be explored utilizing the perspectives of the relevant actors: archaeologists, collectors, museums, developers, descendant communities, national and local governments, and the tourism industry.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-13

Anthropology,ANTH,27,Economic Anthropology in a Changing World,"The idea of “the economy” is powerful. Government policies try to make it grow and politicians are voted out if it doesn’t. Fortunes rise and fall with economic indicators and market values. But what is the economy? In this economic anthropology course, we will address this question differently than an Economics course would. Rather than approaching the economy as an abstraction that exists apart from human societies, we will critically explore how it is created and experienced through activities and relationships that are part of everyday life.
Our focus will be on how markets, commodities, labor, property, and money shape people’s identities and relationships. We will pay particular attention to the ways that power works, often invisibly, through economic forms, and how this can make inequality and governmental power appear acceptable and even natural. Finally, we will examine relations between “the economy” and “the environment” in the context of climate change and environmental degradation. Through engagement with ethnographic and other scholarship, students will learn to critically understand key contemporary economic issues in the United States, as well as in countries like Brazil, Egypt, and Italy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-27
Anthropology,ANTH,28,Ethnography of Violence,"Violence is widely recognized as a problem in modern society, with policies and interventions to combat violence, or employ it, dominating local and global politics. Yet the meaning of violence is seldom analyzed. Using an ethnographic lens, this course explores violence as both an embodied experience and a culturally and politically mediated event. We examine spectacular and everyday violence forms of violence in terms of manifestations of power, structures of inequality, perceptions of difference, and politics of representation. Ethnographic studies are drawn from, among others, Mozambique, Haiti, and Harlem. An introduction to the cultural anthropology of violence, this course raises key questions about violence in a globalized world and explores how to study it anthropologically. This course is not open to students who have received credit for ANTH 12.03.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-28
Anthropology,ANTH,29,Landscape Archaeology,"Landscape archaeology seeks to better understand human history through the systematic exploration of large regions, documenting the age and distribution of ancient settlements and other features such as roads, canals, and field systems that are visible on the ground surface.  As opposed to focusing on individual sites, landscape archaeology provides a regional perspective on the ancient world and is therefore uniquely capable of revealing past trends in population, the density and distribution of settlement over time, and the ways that ancient peoples interacted with and understood their environments.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-29
Anthropology,ANTH,31,Gender in Cross-Cultural Perspective,"Sex (biological differences between men and women) and gender (social constructions of those differences) are not straightforward or natural. Gender inequalities are also not straightforward and natural. This course thus pays close attention to issues of power and inequality, including the ways in which Western gender ideals have been imposed on people in other parts of the world. We will also engage with perceptions, images, stories, encounters, games, connections, disconnections, practice and resistance.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-31
Anthropology,ANTH,32,Anthropology of Tibet and the Himalayas,"This course introduces students to the peoples and cultures of Tibet and the greater Himalayan region (Nepal, northern India, Bhutan). We examine the cultural, ecological, political, religious, and economic interfaces that define life on the northern and southern slopes of Earth's greatest mountain range.

Anthropology,ANTH,33,The Global Caribbean,"Paradise or plantation? Cultural destination or economic periphery? Capitalist birthplace or IMF delinquent? From the Columbian conquest to contemporary tourism, the Caribbean has borne the burdens and opportunities of being an intercontinental crossroads. Colonial governments, enslaved Africans, indentured servants, and foreign settlers have all made the Caribbean an exemplar of modernity and globalization—for better or worse. Drawing on social scientific, literary, and policy texts, this course offers an historically deep and geographically broad anthropology of the Caribbean.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-33
Anthropology,ANTH,35,Maya Indians Under Mexican and Guatemalan Rule,"This course explores the contemporary Maya cultures of Mexico and Guatemala against the backdrop of nearly five hundred years of conquest, colonialism, revolution, and nation-building.

Anthropology,ANTH,36,"Contemporary Africa: Exploring Myths, Engaging Realities","This course focuses on processes, relationships, and experiences that have shaped, and continue to shape, the lives of Africans in many different contexts. These include issues of ecology and food production, age, gender, ethnicity, exchange, colonialism, apartheid, and development. We will then embark on in depth readings of ethnographies that engage these issues and themes. In the processes we will move beyond prevailing stereotypes about Africa, to engage the full complexity of its contemporary realities.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-36
Anthropology,ANTH,37,Legacies of Conquest: Latin America,"Despite nearly five hundred years of conquest, colonialism, and change, native peoples still survive in culturally distinct enclaves within the dominant Iberian traditions of Latin America. This course examines the roots as well as the endemic social inequalities and prejudices that resulted. Selected case studies will relate to such contemporary problems as international drug trafficking, deforestation of the Amazon basin, and ongoing political repression and revolution in Central America. The course draws on the insights of local ethnographic studies to shed light on global problems, while anthropologically situating native cultures of Latin America in their larger historical and geopolitical context.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-37
Anthropology,ANTH,38,Human Behavioral Ecology,The human condition is characterized by immense biological and behavioral variation. The extent to which such variation is adaptive is topic a great importance and controversy. Current research in the field of human behavioral ecology reflects a growing interaction between the social and biological sciences. The objectives of this course are to critically examine the origin and development of this discipline and to survey the physiological and behavioral ways that humans interact with their environment.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-38
Anthropology,ANTH,39,Archaeology of the Middle East,"This course provides an introduction to the civilizations of the ancient Middle East and to the history of archaeological research in this important region. Encompassing the modern nations of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel/Palestine, the Near East saw the emergence of the world’s first villages, cities, and empires, and is therefore central to our understanding of human history. Following an overview of its geography, this course offers a survey of Middle Eastern cultural development, art, and archaeology from the earliest evidence of human settlement around 13,000 BC to the conquest of the region by Alexander the Great.

Anthropology,ANTH,40,Human Functional Anatomy,"Anatomy is a science of nomenclature; it provides a universal language for understanding how and why form supports function. Such a biomechanical conceptual framework can inform our understanding of human biology. Yet the anatomical novelties that characterize modern humans are best appreciated when contextualized against living nonhuman primates and the hominin fossil record. Student grades will be based on a mastery of concepts from lectures and labs featuring cadavers, skeletal materials, models, and casts.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-40
Anthropology,ANTH,41,Human Evolution,The fossil record demonstrates that humans evolved from an extinct ape that lived in Africa more than 5 million years ago. Paleoanthropology is the branch of biological anthropology that seeks to document and explain the evolution of our lineage using paleontological and archaeological data. This course provides a survey of human evolution in light of current scientific debates. Emphasis will be placed on reconstructing the biology and behavior of prehistoric species.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-41
Anthropology,ANTH,42,Medical Gross Anatomy: Scars of Human Evolution,"Human anatomy is important for medical professionals, artists, and anthropologists. This dissection-based course will explore the human body and its many imperfections. The deficiencies of our bodies —clumsy compromises in our teeth, feet, backs, bottoms, and birthings— are chronic clinical concerns that reflect our evolutionary history. Taking a cue from Wilton Krogman’s 1951 classic, Scars of Human Evolution, this course will demonstrate how and how far the human body fails by the standards of intelligent design.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-42
Anthropology,ANTH,43,Human Osteology,"Human osteology is an important component of biological anthropology, with applications in archaeology, paleontology, forensics, and medicine. This course is designed to acquaint students with the normal anatomy of the human skeleton. Our focus is the identification of isolated and fragmentary skeletal remains. Students are introduced to principles of bone growth and remodeling, biomechanics, morphological variation within and between populations, pathology, ancient DNA, taphonomy, and forensics. Practical techniques are developed in regular laboratory sessions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-43
Anthropology,ANTH,44,"Language, Gender & Sexuality","This course will introduce students to foundational and current thinking about the connections among language, gender, and sexuality, from readings in linguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and feminist theory. A cross-cultural approach will characterize the class, and units will link language, gender and sexuality to themes such as power, (in)equality, and identity. Students will also be encouraged to consider the significance of gender and sexuality in the context of quotidian language use.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-44
Anthropology,ANTH,45,Asian Medical Systems,"This course investigates systems of healing practiced in, and derived from, Asia. We will focus primarily on three Asian medical systems: Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and Tibetan medicine. We will strive to understand how these medical systems are based on coherent logics that are not only biologically but also culturally determined. We will also analyze the deployment of these medical systems in non-Asian contexts, and examine the relationship between Asian systems and ""western"" biomedicine.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-45
Anthropology,ANTH,47,Alaska: American Dreams and Native Realities,"Since the time United States ""purchased"" Alaska from Russia, this land has been seen by many as the ""last frontier"" - a place where tough and adventurous Euro-Americans could strike it rich or get away from the negative consequences of civilized living. Using anthropological and historical works as well as fiction, film and other media, the seminar explores the mythology surrounding the ""land of the midnight sun."" This myth of the ""last frontier"" - in its development-driven as well as conservationist versions -- is also contrasted with the ways Native Alaskans' have viewed and lived on their land.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-47
Anthropology,ANTH,48,From the Sacred to Salvation: The Place of Religion in Human Societies,"This course examines religions as cultural systems that give shape and meaning to people's lives and provide them a means, in the form of rituals, to affect their worlds and themselves. The emphasis is on understanding non-Western religions, especially local traditions, through the interpretation of myth, ritual, and symbolism. The relationship of religion to political power and ideology is also explored.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-48
Anthropology,ANTH,49,"Environment, Culture, and Sustainability",Environmental problems cannot be understood without reference to cultural values that shape the way people perceive and interact with their environment. In this course we will engage with cultural difference with special attention to how the American experience has shaped the ways in which Americans imagine and interact with the environment. We will pay close attention to issues of consumption and conservation and how they have impacted ecologies and human livelihoods around the world.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-49
Anthropology,ANTH,50.03,Digital Archaeology,"This course will examine how digital technologies, particularly in the geospatial realm, are transforming the ways in which we discover, explore, and interpret the human past. Students will investigate archaeological questions while learning both the art and science of rapidly developing software, instruments, and techniques. The first unit of the course explores regional-scale archaeological problems and the use of aerial and satellite imaging, and GIS-based spatial analysis. We then turn to site-based investigations using archaeological geophysics, photogrammetry, and drones. The final weeks turn to 3D modeling, visualization, and immersive archaeological realties.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-03
Anthropology,ANTH,50.04,Digital Heritage: Global Politics and Practices,"This course explores the idea of heritage as less of a “thing” and more of a cultural and social process—one that harnesses the act of remembering to create ways to understand and engage with the world. In recent decades, fostered not least through international organizations such as UNESCO World Heritage or the World Monuments Fund, heritage preservation has become a global political movement. Following both a historical and a comparative approach, this course seeks to transcend the Euro-American understanding of heritage, which is still very much the standard in international advisory bodies and address the various unrepresented perspectives, value systems, and frameworks of memory that play a role in heritage as a global phenomenon. As such, this course is designed to be a tool to both study and question heritage preservation and conservation.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-04
Anthropology,ANTH,50.05,Environmental Archaeology,"Archaeological sites preserve not just architectural and artifactual remains, but important clues to how people lived in and acted on their environment. In this course we will explore the types of data used to reconstruct ancient environments and examine theoretical approaches to human-environment relationships. Through case studies, we will confront contentious issues in environmental archaeology and learn how archaeologists integrate the archaeological record with data from history, biology, and geosciences.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-05
Anthropology,ANTH,50.17,Rites of Passage: The Biology and Culture of Life's Transitions,"This course explores the “rites of passage” concept across time and space, and with close attention to the ways that our bodies shape and are shaped by our social selves. A response to avid student desire to learn more about the intersections of biology and culture within the context of anthropology, this course promotes learning about human biology and the medical humanities.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-17
Anthropology,ANTH,50.18,Anthropocene Imaginaries,"The world warms, and global environmental imaginaries transform. Evolving representations of culture and environment have compelling implications for human rights and indigenous sovereignties over land, water and natural resources. Human security will be shaped not only by the unfolding impacts of climate change, but also by how we frame the understandings and ethical commitments we articulate in response to them. This course will explore the anthropology of climate change, and consider how visions and aesthetics of place in the twenty-first century are interconnected with transforming global discourses about environmental security, governance and power. Blending environmental humanities and social science perspectives, we will also reflect upon critical approaches to political ecology and the idea of “the Anthropocene” itself.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-18
Anthropology,ANTH,50.21,Filmmaking and Visual Culture,"This course is a course where we both learn to make films and examine theories of visual art, sound, film, and digital media. We will learn how to think about and make sounds and images in historically and ethnographically rich ways. In the process we examine notions of power, difference, history, culture, race, class, gender. Twentieth-century politics were intimately linked to the rapid development of radio, television, film, video, and digital media. These media have creatively engaged with local cultural practices around the world in reshaping the nature of artistic expression, national, gendered, and racial difference, and political power. We examine notions of visuality from the perspective of African and African diasporic political configurations and aesthetic responses. This course explores the politics and pragmatics of art, photography, and film in order to delineate visual, sonic,  and embodied ways of presenting and experiencing the world particularly in relation to race and gender.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-21
Anthropology,ANTH,50.22,"Sovereignty, Race, and Rights","This course examines the colonial legacies of rights, race, gender, and difference and their significance for contemporary global politics and development. By taking an socio-historical approach to the idea of rights we will make connections between sovereignty, the rule of law, representational practices, economy, and citizenship. We will use a critical eye to explore the conditions of possibility that allow states, development organizations, donor agencies, and individuals to unwittingly reproduce centuries-old tropes of poverty, degradation, and helplessness of non-Western peoples. Examining various institutionally structured encounters between Europeans and non-Western peoples we unpack assumptions about the naturalness of power. In postcolonial societies the tensions between ideas of tradition and modernity structure many conflicts over rights, citizenship, and the role of the individual in society.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-22
Anthropology,ANTH,50.25,"Law, Power & Society","What is law? In this course, we will explore this seemingly simple question, and look at how scholars from anthropology and other disciplines have addressed it. We will look at law as a means of ordering societies, as an exercise of power, and as a cultural phenomenon that helps us better understand the world around us. We will survey foundational and philosophical thought, delve into law’s role in the United States, and study its manifestations in colonial and postcolonial societies, such as South Africa and Brazil. We will explore the law as both a means of social control and of social change.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-25
Anthropology,ANTH,50.30,Human and Comparative Gross Anatomy,"Human and Comparative Gross Anatomy is a laboratory class that offers undergraduate students the rare opportunity to learn anatomy through anatomical dissection. Students will work in small teams to dissect human body donors, with various other vertebrate animals also available for dissection and study. Cadaver dissection is the best method by which to learn about the structures of the human body, their integration, and, most importantly, variation among humans. This is an intensive course, requiring hours of study both in the lab and from texts, but it rewards you for those hours with a strong understanding of anatomy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-30
Anthropology,ANTH,50.31,"Humanistic Medicine: Cultivating Compassion in Healers, Patients, and Cultures of Care","This course uses experiences of illness and efforts to heal as windows into what it means to be human. Grounded in an interdisciplinary, holistic approach, this course aims to build connections between humanistic inquiry, medicine, and diverse forms of care. The course is organized around three main themes: (1) Becoming a Doctor and the Culture of Biomedicine, (2) Exploring Disease and Illness, and (3) Building a Future of Compassionate Care. This course is relevant for students in a wide range of disciplines, including students pursuing clinical careers; students engaging with medicine and illness as writers or advocates; and students in the humanities and social sciences who are interested in exploring health, illness, and medicine.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-31
Anthropology,ANTH,50.33,Cartographic Encounters: Mapping Across Cultures,"This course examines diverse practices of mapping across geographic and cultural contexts. We explore the roles that mapmaking has played in past and present societies as well as its futures. We experiment with a variety of applied mapping methods, using both analog and digital approaches. The course includes in-class labs, during which we will explore a different facet of cartography, including work in the Hood Museum on a dedicated exhibition to which students will contribute.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-33

Anthropology,ANTH,50.35,The World Turned Upside Down: An Indigenous History of the Andes after the Spanish Invasion,"This course will explore the tension between insiders and outsiders, colonizers and the colonized, Westerners and Natives. Students will examine not only what these tensions meant for the people of the Andes – in the countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador (and to a lesser extent Chile and Colombia) - but also in what ways similar phenomena occurred in North America and other parts of the world. Among other things, students will investigate differences between insider and outsider accounts, primary and secondary sources, history and archaeology, etc. - while acknowledging the strengths and limitations of these different sources and approaches.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-35
Anthropology,ANTH,50.36,"Anthropology and Narrative: Life History, Oral History,  and the Ethnographer’s Story",This seminar aims to expand students’ understanding of the power of storytelling in anthropology and to guide them in reading such stories with a critical eye. Students will have the opportunity to conduct their own life history projects as well as to produce a critical analysis of course readings or of texts of their own choosing.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-36
Anthropology,ANTH,50.37,Archaeologies of Religion,"Most of humanity’s religious history is only accessible using archaeological evidence. Moreover, even where texts are available, they tend to reflect the perspective of elites. This course therefore explores how archaeological methods can help us better understand religious phenomena in past societies. Topics will include the religion (or lack thereof) of our hominid ancestors (e.g. Neanderthals), the state religions of ancient civilizations, and the complementary perspective that archaeology provides on the World Religions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-50-37
Anthropology,ANTH,51,Colonialism and Its Legacies in Anthropological Perspective,"Between the 16th and mid-20th centuries, European nations and Japan colonized much of the rest of the world. This course examines similarities and differences in the practices of these colonial powers in different regions at different times and the impact they had on indigenous peoples and societies. It traces the ways in which colonial processes and experiences have shaped the politics, economics, and identities of both developed and developing nations in the world today.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-51

Anthropology,ANTH,55,Anthropology of Global Health,"This course explores human responses to disease and illness from the perspective of medical anthropology, with a particular focus on international health. In this context, 'global health' not only refers to health care systems, medical practices, and ideas about illness and the body in cross-cultural contexts, but also encompasses issues of health development paradigms, culture and epidemiology, global health equity and human rights issues.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-55
Anthropology,ANTH,57,Origins of Inequality,"What led human societies to accept social inequality? This question is as old as the earliest political writings and a central theoretical issue in anthropology. With the collection of detailed archaeological data from multiple world regions, anthropologists have developed case studies for working out the emergence of social inequality. This course will explore the theoretical expectations of multiple approaches to inequality, and then focus on current archaeological evidence from multiple world regions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-57
Anthropology,ANTH,58,Sustainable Cities,"Trends suggest that the human experience is increasingly an urban one, with urbanization transforming social and ecological worlds at a rapid pace. With these changes comes a growing urgency to enhance the sustainability of cities. In this course we compare past and present forms of urbanization, with an emphasis on understanding specific challenges and solutions to sustainability.   In doing so, we think about how urbanization is embedded in broader socio-ecological processes that transform rural lands and livelihoods.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-58
Anthropology,ANTH,60,Psychological Anthropology,"This course examines key concepts and core debates within the field of psychological anthropology. The course draws on the historical roots of the field as well as contemporary theoretical developments in psychological anthropology. Central questions addressed in the course include: What is the relationship of the individual to culture?   How do categories of the person, self, thought, and emotions vary cross-culturally? What do extraordinary psychological experiences reveal about fundamental human processes?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-60
Anthropology,ANTH,62,Health and Disease in Evolutionary Perspective,"This course explores how principles from biological anthropology can provide insight into human health and disease. This course also asks students to critically analyze prevailing medical concepts of 'normal' physiology and illness.

Throughout the course, students will evaluate current controversies surrounding medical models of childbirth, breastfeeding, and co-sleeping.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-64
Anthropology,ANTH,65,Conservation and Development,"The terms ‘conservation’ and ‘development’ are ubiquitous, but there is little agreement on their meanings or their efficacy. We study how these processes impact ‘traditional’ cultures and how indigenous peoples have responded. Development and conservation have cultures of their own so we will examine their worldviews, discourses, and practices. We explore how anthropological methods can be used to analyze resource conflicts, understand the limits of dominant approaches, and think constructively about alternatives.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-65
Anthropology,ANTH,66,Human Biological Variation,"How do human populations adapt to their local environments? What is more important for influencing human variation—genes or the environment?

Anthropology,ANTH,72,Ethnicity and Nationalism,"Ethnic politics and nationalist movements dominated the 20th century and continue to play a major role in shaping the world today. This course explores these important subjects through an anthropological lens by examining such topics as the symbols, rituals and myths of ethnic and national identity; nationalism, ethnic minorities and the state; and homeland and diaspora nationalism. Ethnographic case studies range from indigenous nationalism to that of the newly independent states of Eastern and Central Europe.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-72
Anthropology,ANTH,73,Main Currents in Anthropology,"This course examines the theoretical concerns that define anthropology as a discipline. Readings by major theorists past and present address the nature and extent of human social and cultural variation, the relationship of institutional arrangements in society to systems of meaning, the material and moral determinants of human social life, the dynamics of change within and between cultures, and the place of power in maintaining and transforming meaningfully constituted human orders.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-73
Anthropology,ANTH,74,The Human Spectrum,"Contemporary foraging peoples are often viewed as ecological relicts and therefore instructive models for understanding the selective pressures that gave rise to the human condition. The objective of this course is to critically evaluate this enduring concept by examining the spectrum of human interactions with tropical habitats. We will also evaluate the basis of recent popular trends - the paleo diet, raw foodism, barefoot running, parent-child co-sleeping - that emphasize the advantages of a ""natural"" pre-agricultural lifestyle.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-74
Anthropology,ANTH,75,"Ecology, Culture, and Environmental Change","Anthropology's interest in the interactions of humans and their environments has been long-standing, especially in archaeology. In this seminar we will consider changing conceptual frameworks for understanding human-environmental interactions and long-standing debates about nature vs. culture, materialist vs. symbolic approaches, the development of cultural ecology, and the new ""ecologies."" We will draw on the research of archaeologists, biological and cultural anthropologists, geographers, and historians.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-75

Art History,ARTH,10.03,Art in Egypt,"Mummies, pyramids, curses and death, these are some of the images and associations that one conjures up with the mention of ancient Egypt today. Ancient Egyptian civilization is an endlessly fascinating field for intellectual inquiry and debate, the subject of spectacular museum displays, as well as a source of inspiration for various reenactments in literature and film. The modern attraction for Egypt has its origins in Napoleon’s invasion of the country in 1798, and later, and more profoundly, in the 1922 discovery of the tomb of king Tutankhamen in the Valley of the Kings. However, already in the ancient world, the Greeks and Romans expressed fascination for the monuments and the civilization of Egypt, primarily as they experienced its material culture through travel and other cultural exchanges. In this course we will study key works of art and architecture in ancient Egypt as well as explore some important instances in the subsequent reception of Egyptian monuments, history, and mythology.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-10-03

Art History,ARTH,27.01,The Ideal City,"This course explores the Renaissance phenomenon of the “ideal city” – its origins, successes, and spectacular failures. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, major artists and architects like Leonardo da Vinci participated in a radical experiment that transformed how urban spaces were designed, represented, and built. The Renaissance city was reinvented as a utopia, featuring straight processional avenues, a rigid street plan, and monumental sculptures inserted into public squares like props on a stage. We will consider a wide range of case studies, from fictional cities imagined in the pages of sketchbooks to new cities and towns that were built from the ground up. Throughout, we will question how architects exploited the basic infrastructure of daily life – roads, gates, walls, squares, and even sewage systems – to perfect their environments. How were those principles used to promote civic virtue and good governance or to reinforce social hierarchies and absolutist rule? We will make frequent visits to the Rauner Special Collections Library to work directly with rare books.

Art History,ARTH,28.01,De-Centering the Renaissance,"How was the Renaissance reshaped, reinvented, and transformed as it traveled across the globe during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries? This course challenges our definition of the Renaissance by highlighting art and architecture produced outside the traditional Italian centers of Florence, Rome, and Venice. Each week will focus on a region typically marginalized in Renaissance studies, from the Iberian Peninsula to Ottoman Turkey. We will consider topics such as: the exchange of models, techniques, and materials between foreign workshops; the traveling artist and architect; cultural and artistic hybridity; differing approaches to the revival of antiquity; the relationship between center and periphery; the development of local styles; and colonialism. Students will have an opportunity to think critically about how an art historical canon is constructed and how it might evolve. Throughout, we will question the current trend in the field toward globalism: what are the values and risks of this new approach to the study of Renaissance art and architecture?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-01

The course will explore the ways religious and political institutions exploited the arts for their own propagandistic ends, and examine as well how images of the period satisfied patrons’ interests in the familiar and exotic, optical illusions, and spectacle and drama.  Among the artists whose works will be discussed are Caravaggio, Bernini, Artemisia Gentileschi, Velazquez, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Jan Steen and Poussin.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-02
Art History,ARTH,28.03,Vision and Reality: The Art of Northern Europe in the Fifteenth Century,"The fifteenth century in northern Europe is an amalgam of influences that form our idea of the modern. The concerns and styles of the Late Gothic are present, mixing with new forms of technology, such as printing or the perfection of oil painting techniques. The weakened grip of the Church contributes to the emerging emphasis on the individual that characterizes Early Modern art. The fifteenth century sees the rise of secular art, the concept of objective realism, the development of panel painting, the commercialization of prints, and the beginnings of independent portraiture. My goal is to give you the knowledge and skills that will enable you to understand and appreciate the nuances and complexity in fifteenth-century artworks wherever you encounter them. In addition to the mastery of scholarly materials, you will work on reading visual culture, practicing your writing skills and perfecting your oral communication.     Our focus will be on reception, context and invention.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-03
Art History,ARTH,28.04,Reform and Response in Sixteenth-century Northern Europe,"In 1517 Martin Luther nailed the 95 Theses to the door of the castle chapel in Wittenberg. That act was the culmination of decades of frustration with an established Church that, to many believers, had lost its way. What followed was a European debate for the very souls of men. The Reformation brought into question the assumptions by which most Europeans had lived—that the Church’s teachings, personal good actions, and Christ’s sacrifice could insure their salvation. Using the printing press and artworks, both sides presented their positions in propagandistic language that could be both bombastic and subtle. We will look at this central event in the shaping of free will, and how it played out in the art created in Northern Europe at that time.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-04
Art History,ARTH,28.05,Art & Society in the Age of the Rococo,"This course explores the transformative period in European art and culture between 1700 and 1800, when the playful decadence of the Rococo gave way to the morally purified art of Neoclassicism. We will study the “high arts” of painting, sculpture & architecture in the context of an expanded realm of visual culture, including interior design and decorative objects, clothing and fashion, hairstyles and luxury goods, the art market and the print trade.  We will investigate the political and social uses of art at the time paying special attention to alternative discourses of power spoken through fashion, gesture and influence. We will examine court culture, the new public sphere, the growth of the middle class, the Grand Tour, the expanded role of women in the 18th century as patrons and artists, and the socio-political changes leading up to the French Revolution. Artists include Hogarth, Watteau, Boucher, Kauffman, Reynolds, Adam, Greuze, among others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-05
Art History,ARTH,28.06,European Art in the Age of Revolution (1750-1850),"Visual arts were transformed in the second half of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth century by dramatic upheavals in social, political and cultural life. In addition to taking account of stylistic movements such as Rococo, Neo-classicism and Romanticism, we will devote our attention to relationships between artistic and social change, political and institutional pressures upon artists, changing ideas of art’s purpose and audience, and artists’ shift to direct engagement with modern life.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-06
Art History,ARTH,28.07,Art Writing and Writers on Art,"This course will explore the various modes of writing on or about art and artists from the early modern to the modern period in Europe. Focusing primarily on writers and texts from France, Germany and Italy, we will consider the social and cultural roles of the artist and art works as they were formulated, investigated and reinterpreted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The classical revival and the beginnings of “modern” art history, the growth of the periodical press and the explosion of art (and literary) criticism, the growing public sphere for art, the biographical tendency in historical writing, and Romantic fantasies of the artist all worked to create a rich body of literary or quasi-literary writings on art and artists at this time.
 Many of the texts we will read were translated into other languages soon after their initial appearance, testifying to the international readership and scope of these writers and their works. The figure of the artist as developed in the 18th and 19th centuries only became more prominent in our cultural consciousness in the 20th century as Romanticism’s ideas of genius and the vanguard (often mad) artist and the separate sphere of the visual arts became entrenched in discourses of modernism. Exploring writings on art at this critical juncture in the beginnings of modernism can shed light on our continuing notions of what art is and has been, and on how art and artists have been described, understood, and fantasized about for centuries.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-07
Art History,ARTH,28.08,Italian Art from Renaissance to Baroque: Crisis and Invention,"In studios and workshops across early modern Italy, artists developed new forms, styles, and ideas that transformed how they responded to the changing world around them. With a focus on the years between 1400 and 1700, this course will consider the cultural dynamics that gave the arts new meaning and urgency and fueled innovations in Italian cities large and small. Taking a chronological approach to the Renaissance and Baroque periods, we will consider topics such as: self-fashioning and identity; the role of art in moments of ideological or political crisis; the dialogue between art and technology; and visual drama and deception. We will explore a wide range of objects, from the private pages of sketchbooks to painted ceilings, and from colossal sculptures to viral prints. Throughout, we will question how artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, Caravaggio, and Bernini manipulated diverse materials and theorized the process of invention. The course will include frequent visits to the Hood Museum of Art and the Rauner Special Collections Library.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-08
Art History,ARTH,28.09,Art on the Move: Renaissance Italy and the Islamic World,"During the Renaissance, innovations in art and architecture constantly moved back and forth between Italy and the Islamic world. New design models, styles of ornamentation, and even building methods became part of a shared artistic and architectural language that crossed cultural and geographical boundaries in the Mediterranean. This introductory course will focus on exchanges between Italian centers such as Venice, Florence, and Pisa and the Mamluk Sultanate, the Safavid Empire, and the Ottoman Empire between the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571). We will consider a wide range of case studies, including: the role of the traveling painter and architect in foreign courts; the trade in luxury goods such as textiles and ceramics; common trends in villa and garden culture; and the re-appropriation of objects and monuments. How did such a rich history of cross-cultural contact emerge against a backdrop of military strife, political rivalry, and religious tension? To answer this question, we will explore contemporary theories of artistic mobility, hybridity, and influence. The course will include an excursion to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, as well as visits to the Rauner Special Collections Library and the Hood Museum of Art.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-28-09

Art History,ARTH,31.02,"Art and Industry: The Visual and Material Culture of South Asia, 1800 to present","This course examines the relationship between art and industry through the visual and material culture of South Asia from 1800 to the present. The first third of the course will focus on the colonial discourse of art and economy, and the fear that industrial production would destroy indigenous craft and design. This instigated a colonial system of education, and the creation of museums, that taught both the European ‘fine arts’ of painting and sculpture, and the Indian ‘applied arts’ of craft and design in practice and in objects. The second third of the course will attend to specific media as physical and intellectual conduits in the economy. We will discuss the explosive effect of the technologies of print and photography in colonial control and nationalist agitation. We will also examine the materiality of textiles, clay, wood, metal, plastic, paper, and food in their production, exhibition display, and cultural and political context. The last third of the course will focus on modern artists’ considerations of art and craft, the formation of national museums, and the contemporary art market. In parallel to the attention to visual and material objects, we will read selections from primary sources on art and industry, such as George C. Birdwood’s Industrial Arts of India (1880), The Journal of Indian Art and Industry, Mahatma Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj (1909), and K. G. Subrahmanyan’s Eclecticism (1992).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-31-02

We will look at Goguryeo mural paintings, Goryeo Buddhist Paintings, and Joseon landscapes, portraits, genre, and folk paintings, as well as Korea’s modern and contemporary art, including North Korean propaganda posters. We will ask questions like: How have Korean paintings reflected changes in religious beliefs, political idealogy, and material culture? What quintessential aesthetica values (if any) are found in Korean painting? How much does contemporary “global” Korean painting contain the legacy of the Korean painting tradition?

Art History,ARTH,38.03,East Meets West,"This class explores the interaction between the cultures of East Asia and the West from as early as c. 200 BCE to the early 20th century. The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world’s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have “the Pottery War” and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters’ on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes. This course requires no previous experience, but is intended for those who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and culture.

Art History,ARTH,40.01,American Art and Identity,"Where is America? What makes America distinct? How have images of America helped to define and challenge our ideas about who “we” are? In this course we study how paintings, photographs, monuments, and other forms of visual culture have shaped the America we know today. We will trace the emergence of U.S.-American art and identity from the point of Encounter, through Independence, and up to the Centennial Celebrations of Columbus’ “discovery of America” in 1893 through discreet comparisons with developments in Mexico, and Canada. The course is organized chronologically around a series of themes that foreground the intersection between class, race, gender, and nation-building. Students will learn how to identify and analyze the key genres and styles of 19th century American art, including portraiture, photography, ledger drawing, monuments, and landscape, history, and genre painting. They will consider how character and class are constructed through the portrait; how the claims of settler nationalism are naturalized through landscape; how anxieties about racial emancipation, immigration, and gender advancement are managed through images of the “people;” how war both consolidated and radically challenged prevailing conceptions of American identity; and how minoritized populations challenged the dominant construction of “America” throughout this period. There are no pre-requisites for this course. It has been designed as an introduction to the field of American art history as well as to the discipline of Art History more generally. First year students and non-majors are welcome.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-40-01
Art History,ARTH,40.02,The American Century: Modern Art in the United States,"What made the 20th century the “American Century”? In this course we will examine how painting, sculpture, photography, public murals, and monuments contributed to the political and economic rise and cultural dominance of the United States in the 20th century. Find out: how artists from the US and Mexico contributed to the search for the “Americanness” of American art; how African-Americans, Native Americans, Latino/as, women, and queer Americans have contributed to and challenged the image of America they created; how artists participated in the Cold War; and in turn, how the Cultural Cold War spawned a radical counter-culture and a new “culture war” over identity in the 1990s. In this course, students will develop a basic understanding of the development of U.S. American art—the major figures, movements, and themes—over the course of the 20th century; learn how to visually analyze and write about works of art executed in different media and for different viewing contexts; learn how to locate a specific artist’s handling of a subject, theme, or motif within a particular socio-political context and be able to compare and contrast different artistic expressions of a subject, theme, or motif across time, develop a more nuanced understanding of social movements in the 20th century United States, develop a greater appreciation for the contributions of minoritized groups to American art, culture, and history; question received notions of “American” culture and identity; and engage in productive discussion about the strategic value, situated meaning, and intersectionality of nation, class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and identity.

Art History,ARTH,40.03,Twentieth Century Art from Latin America,"This course is an introductory survey of art produced by artists living in Latin and Latin@ America during the 20th century. We will approach this topic through case studies of the major figures and movements in the cosmopolitan centers of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and the U. S. We will treat Latin America as a geopolitical construct rather than an essential unity. Throughout the course we will be attentive to the distinctive character of the different national histories, populations, and cultural traditions that have shaped artistic production in this region while still acknowledging points of convergence, influence, and shared conviction among them. We will examine how national identity, racial formation, class difference, gender inequality, political struggle, and state violence have been addressed by artists from the region and in diaspora. Students will learn about the major figures, movements, and genres of Latin and Latin@ American art: such as, modernismo, muralism, social realism, surrealism, geometric abstraction, kinetecism, and neo-concretismo, Latin American pop and conceptual art, installation, performance, and exhibition practices. They will develop an appreciation for the racialized modernisms of many Latin American countries and an ability to compare and contrast different iterations of hybridity from Mexican Indigenismo, to afro-Cubanismo, to Brazilian Anthropophagism (cannibalism), among others. They will develop an appreciation for how artists from Latin America have intervened in international avant-garde discourses by developing “ex-centric” strategies or ethics of avant-gardism. And they will explore the critical and reciprocal relationship between Latin American modernisms and state modernization and authoritarianism. This course has no pre-requisites and is accessible to both majors and non-majors. Students need no prior knowledge about Art History or Latin American art and history.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-40-03
Art History,ARTH,40.04,Mexicanidad: Constructing and Dismantling Mexican National Identity,"Since the Mexican Revolution (1910-17), artists, intellectuals, and state-actors have endeavored to define and re-define Mexican national identity, or what is known as Mexicanidad. From the 1920s and 30s, when an emphasis was placed on Mexico’s rural and indigenous populations to the 1940s and 50s, when greater attention was given to Mexican modernization, through the years after 1968, when artists and intellectuals endeavored to reveal the repressive nature of Mexicanidad and its role in propagandizing an authoritarian state and ruling party. In this course we will place artists like José Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance. We will cover art produced in Mexico from the turn of the 20th century through the “boom” years of the 1990s, with a focus on issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality throughout. Students will learn about the history of Mexican art, enhance skills in the visual analysis of modern and contemporary art, refine their ability to conduct original research and write effectively, and develop an understanding of how visual culture participates in the construction of national identity as well as how art can critique and queer that construction. This course has no pre-requisites and requires no prior knowledge of Art History or Mexican art and history.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-40-04
Art History,ARTH,40.05,Latinx Art & Activist Print Media,"Since the late 1960s, printmaking and print cultures have been at the center of constructing identity discourses for Latinx communities in the United States. Through the analysis of prints, political graphics, comics, zines, and ephemera, we will study how the printed image negotiates relations of power. From posters of United Farm Worker boycotts and broadsides of the Young Lords to contemporary prints that narrate stories of migration and belonging, we will delve into graphic media and consider notions of authorship (collective/individual), activism, display, dissemination, consumption, collecting, and technology. Students will learn to think critically and empathetically about how these collective modes of art-making foreground the politics of representation: what we see, how we see, who gets to control our image, and how can printed multiples challenge those narratives. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, gain experience in collaborative printmaking, and refine their ability to conduct original research.

This course explores the radical visual culture of the period in painting, sculpture, prints and photography, from the realism of Courbet and Manet to the abstraction of Seurat and Cézanne. We will focus on how new technologies, political and social revolutions, and exhibition culture influenced the work of Cassatt, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh and Rodin, among others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-41-01

We will examine “avant-garde” artistic practice as a cultural phenomenon, studying individual artists and their associated movements (Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, Dad, Surrealism) through themes such as artistic responses to mass culture; new forms of technology; representations of sexual, racial, and class identity; and the relationship between art, nationalism, war and revolution.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-41-02
Art History,ARTH,41.03,European Art 1750-1850,"European culture was transformed during the period 1750-1850. The absolutist monarchy established by Louis XIV would end with the traumatic rupture of the French Revolution. Napoleon redrew the map of Europe. The aristocracies that had ruled the West for a millennium, withered as the bourgeoisie and working classes struggled for control. The optimism of the Enlightenment slowly soured into the brooding inwardness of Romantic melancholia. The rise of mass industrial production and consumption would be accompanied by waves of technological and social change that irrevocably altered daily life. European powers pursued global dominance through colonial expansion with renewed vigor and brutality. This course examines these epochal changes through the lends of European cultural production, covering key artistic movements such as the Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and Realism. We will closely analyze major works of art and visual culture alongside primary, historical texts of the period. These will be supplemented with recent scholarship that will help situate the works under investigation within the rich and complex social and intellectual milieu in which they were produced.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-41-03
Art History,ARTH,41.04,European Art: 1850-1900,"This course will survey the history of European art the second half of the nineteenth century in a variety of media: painting, sculpture, print media, architecture and design. This is a rich and fascinating period of art-making as well as cultural and technological transformation \u2015a period during which political instability, industrialization, colonialism, and the growth of popular culture had an enormous impact on the production, style, and presentation of art. Old systems of patronage and institutional control over artists dissolved, leaving them to experiment with how to give form to “modernity,” and how to address a widening public audience for their art. Lectures and readings will shift between broad themes in 19th-century art coupled with in-depth examination of singular works, the goal being to strike a balance between close attention to art’s formal means and an account of what its chosen subject matter may have meant, to the artists themselves and to their public.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-41-04
Art History,ARTH,42.01,Unmaking History: Contemporary Art in the Middle East,"This course focuses primarily on the work of contemporary artists who make work in or about the so-called Middle East. It includes recent works by artists from nations as diverse as Algeria, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Turkey and the UAE. One of the main objectives of the course is to look at art practices that attempt to deepen our understanding of the varied cultures, ethnicities and societies that are found in this part of the world. The geographic focus of the course–mostly the Muslim nations of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa–is not meant to perpetuate the assumptions about this region as a monolithic geopolitical entity, nor to blindly label its production according to existing ethnic, religious or national categories. Against media stereotypes of the region, the artists studied in this course have made work that function as a critical platform for rethinking traditional identity formations and extending the space of cultural encounter across borders (territorial, political, linguistic). In many cases these artists may not be living and working in their country of birth but their ethnicity, religion or citizenship continues to inform both their own sense of identity and the terms of their art practice. Some of the topics to be discussed include: artistic responses to the Arab-Israeli conflict, representations of everyday life in times of war, the movement and obstruction of people, goods and information across borders, the rise of new art markets in the Middle East, the politics of gender and sexuality in the Arab world, and the of use archival documents to rethink the meaning of evidence, truth and testimony.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-42-01

Art History,ARTH,47.02,Modern Architecture,"Architectural historians disagree about the origins of the modern era. For many, “modern” suggests principally the built works of the twentieth century. Others find the great projects of the nineteenth-century industrial revolution a more suitable place to begin. Still others—as will we—push the beginnings of “modern” architectural thought and practice back to the late eighteenth century. In this way we place architectural transformation in the context of the great changes taking place in the political, artistic, social and intellectual life of the period. This course approaches architecture as a cultural product and investigates the relationship between buildings, the ideas embodied in buildings and the cultures that designed them.

We will examine the structural conditions of art making in the academy and the studio, the market and the exhibition. We will investigate gendered notions of genius, creativity and originality, including the status of women artists as “exceptional.” Looking also at the female nude in Western art and feminist art in post-modernism, we will analyze the roles that femininity and masculinity play in modernism. With a focus mostly on the 18th-20th c., major figures include Artemisia Gentileschi and Judith Leyster, Mme de Pompadour, Elisabeth Vigée-LeBrun, Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, Frida Kahlo, Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman, among others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-48-04
Art History,ARTH,48.05,"Satire: Art, Politics & Critique","Satire has been used since antiquity as a powerful form of political, social and cultural critique. With humor, sarcasm, and often biting criticism, satire goes beyond pure comedy to speak with a moral voice. The targets of satire range from the world of fashion and the everyday to that of politics and high culture. We will examine case studies of satirical production, from the 18th century through the late 20th century, from the darkly comic prints of Hogarth and Daumier, to the overtly humorous and/or subversive gestures of Duchamp and Dada, Warhol and Pop Art, to the satire of gender roles and modern capitalism in Postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert). This course hopes to come to terms with the broad range and appeal of satire in the visual arts.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-48-05

Students will develop a toolkit for analyzing the way borders shape culture and identity (race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, and ethnicity) in transnational points of contact. With an emphasis on printmaking, performance, photography, and film, the course will dwell on borders that respond to paradigms of fear and desire, contagion and containment, utopia and dystopia. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, and refine their ability to conduct original research.

Art History,ARTH,48.07,Michelangelo’s Modernism,"In 1837 Eugène Delacroix named Michelangelo Buonarroti the “father of modern art.”  What led the great 19th century Romantic painter and critic to identify the Florentine sculptor, painter, architect, and poet as the origin of the modern school? Declared “divine,” during his lifetime, he has been celebrated as the non plus ultra of artistic genius, or vilified as the very epitome of artistic excess ever since. Enthusiasts and detractors alike have viewed Michelangelo as the model of the self-conscious artist. This course will trace ‘il divino’s’ role in the formation of the cult of the modern artist through examining artworks and texts ranging from the artist’s lifetime and afterlife in art, literature, and film. Beginning with the construction of Michelangelo’s persona by early biographers, we will consider why he came to embody the tension between the demands of tradition and innovation like no other artist. Each week we will closely investigate artworks in dialogue with primary sources in English translation. Secondary texts selected from the superb scholarly literature on Michelangelo and his afterlife will be used to supplement primary materials. Throughout the course we will consider the idea of Michelangelo and the Michelangesque functioned through five centuries of cultural production.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-48-07
Art History,ARTH,48.08,The Photographic Medium,"The invention of the photograph radically changed the way we experience the world. The selfie and Instagram are but two of the most recent ways in which photographic technology has become ubiquitous in our everyday lives. This course traces the evolution of the photograph from pre-photographic forms, such as the diorama to its current digital apotheosis. We will focus on how the medium evolved in concert with changing social conditions that shaped, and were shaped in turn, by its evolution. A wide range of practices will be considered, from documentary photographs to fine art. Major figures in photo history will be discussed alongside developments in photographic technology and their impact on photographic imagery in both fine art and visual culture more broadly (advertising, science, journalism). Throughout we will explore photography as a ‘thick’ medium, one inextricably bound up with social and theoretical concerns. Students will exit having a broad knowledge of the historical benchmarks and aesthetic theories of photography, as well as the ability to describe and analyze images in light of photographic technique.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-48-08

During this time, the Italian peninsula was a hotbed of revolutionary ideas about how architecture could shape and be shaped by the human will. The Renaissance saw the emergence of a new type of architecture, which took its cue from the needs, activities, and aspirations of people who defined themselves as “modern.” The chronologically presented material is interspersed with classes dedicated to the broad themes of the course (humanism, the inspirational role of ancient and medieval buildings, living conditions and styles, the rising profession of the architect, etc.).

Art History,ARTH,63.01,Mexican Muralism,"This course provides an introduction to Mexican Muralism by focusing on the “Three Greats”: Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. We will study major works by each artist through in-class discussion as well as by placing different scholarly interpretations in dialog. Students will learn how to visually analyze and interpret mural art. In addition to considering muralism and its relationship to the Mexican Revolution and the post-revolutionary reconstruction of the state and society, we will also consider class and the politics of labor, gender and the politics of the body, sexual identity and the politics of desire, and race and the politics of nationalism in Mexico and the United States in from the 1920s and 30s through the 1960s.

Art History,ARTH,63.13,Bad Art!,"What are the criteria for judging art’s merits?  Who gets to decide?  This course examines the problem of aesthetic hierarchies in terms of the histories of their making and unmaking.  How do  they get constructed, defended, and toppled?  What are the stakes of categorizing some forms of art making as outside of “good taste”?  What does “high” art really mean?  This class will survey key moments in modern art history that reveal charged instances where particular forms of art were deemed beyond the pale or simply not art.   What are the value judgments that take place in order for art to be deemed “bad” or “good”?   We will examine these questions through the historical lens of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, since this was a period that witnessed the democratization of art as we know it today.  At the end of the course, we will reflect on the situation of contemporary art in light of the historical and theoretical questions that we have posed over the course of the term. 
Topics to be considered: the history of art criticism, the fledgling power of the abstract entity called “the public” in terms of art’s reception; modern art and anti-aesthetic tendencies, the mundane and ugly as terms that modern artists elevated in order to distance themselves from middlebrow, bourgeois taste, and the predicament of discerning art’s value today.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-63-13
Art History,ARTH,63.71,Art & Money,"This course will cast a critical eye on the commercial mechanisms of the contemporary art world encompassing auction houses, private galleries, museums, art schools, art fairs, biennales and magazines.  How is commercial value produced in the art market, and what does it have to do with the critical or symbolic value assigned to artworks in the art world more generally?  In addressing this question we will examine the changing function of artistic production within a knowledge or experience-based economy. At the same time, this course will also offer students a critical framework for analyzing the display, marketing and consumption of artworks in a global economy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-63-71
Art History,ARTH,63.72,Aesthetics of the Digital,"This course confronts one of the most urgent and elusive problems of our day: the relationship of aesthetics to the rise of digital media. Drawing on a range of critical texts and artistic practices, we will consider how fundamental aesthetic categories such as materiality and form are transformed through the radical shift from a work-oriented to a medium-oriented conception of art and reality. In broader terms, this module explores the rapidly mutable audio-visual environments/interfaces of the digital age and their impact on social relations and cultural production. We will also examine the tensions between intimacy and distance, distraction and attention, and passivity and participation that characterize image consumption within the routines of contemporary technological culture. Finally, this module offers a historical and political framework for understanding contemporary art’s seeming disavowal of the digital and the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism that underpin it. At the same time, we will assess some of emancipatory possibilities opened by the accessibility and affordability of digital cameras, editing software and mobile devices. As well as making use of the interpretive methods of art history, this module will introduce students to tools drawn from social semiotics, media studies, anthropology, visual culture, cybernetics and design philosophy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-63-72
Art History,ARTH,63.73,Art in the Age of Climate Change,"Since the advent of industrial capitalism, humans have released 555 petagrams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, increasing CO2 concentrations to a level not seen for at least 800,000 years. The long-term consequences of these atmospheric changes remain unknown, but there is already strong evidence that the Earth is rapidly moving into a less biologically diverse, less forested, much warmer, and probably wetter and stormier state. Research on climate change points to a particular irony: human actions have unprecedented impact on the environment, but this produces effects that are increasingly out of human control. Inside that conundrum lies another. Scientists have certain strategies to address urgent environmental challenges, but what of the arts and the humanities? What can practitioners in these fields, in dialogue with the sciences, offer in this moment of climatic disruption and political inaction? To what new modes of visualization does global warming give rise, and how do these aesthetic innovations allow us to live with and through environmental change? What ontological status can be assigned to various biological, geological, and meteorological ‘actors’ if human agency is no longer privileged?
In taking up these questions, this course recognizes that the manifold effects of climate change demand new structures of cross-disciplinary thinking and critical engagement. Accordingly, it draws on concepts and methods drawn from art history and critical theory as well as science and anthropology. As we will see, the field of contemporary art does not simply project forward to predicted catastrophic future scenarios. Rather, it foregrounds the unique capacities of humans to imagine scenarios or worlds that have not yet come into existence.  What, in essence, can art help us imagine that science alone cannot? Through this line of enquiry, this course asks what it means to think through the possibilities and limits of our planet beyond a pessimistic orientation towards foreclosed futures.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-63-73
Art History,ARTH,80.01,Ideals of Physical Beauty: Gender and the Body in Ancient Art,"Since the foundation of Art History as a discipline, Greek art has been admired for its emphasis on physical beauty. Greek culture articulated criteria of beauty for both sexes and created mythological personas exemplifying those ideals. This seminar studies Greek views on beauty and ugliness, as well as the links between beauty and (im)morality. It focuses on how artists went about depicting physicality and explores the connection between perceived beauty and pictorial style, often in comparison with other Mediterranean cultures. Contemporary critical frameworks and theoretical approaches to gender and representation will guide class discussions.
Open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors with instructor’s permission.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-80-01
Art History,ARTH,80.02,Advanced Seminar: Domes,"Domes have graced the skyline of human settlements for over three millennia. The seminar commences with a traditional typological survey of domes, progresses to explore the theoretical foundations that informed their construction, and concludes by examining the social, cultural, and religious factors favoring (or discouraging) their development and proliferation. We will focus especially, but not uniquely, on ancient and medieval domes. Historically, domes have covered a range of buildings: from kilns to tombs, from bell-towers to latrines; however, they most famously crowned places of worship, burial or power. We will ponder: What is a dome? Which qualities define their identities? How and why has the knowledge of dome construction been transferred across time and cultures? What are important methodological considerations to consider as we approach the study of domes?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-80-02
Art History,ARTH,81.02,Advanced Seminar: History of Museums and Collecting,"This course offers a close look at the history of museums and collecting from 16th century cabinets of curiosity to today’s large public museums. Attention will be given to the early history of museums and their theoretical and philosophical foundations, the emergence and guiding principles of public, academic, and donor museums, and recent developments in the museum world and the world of collecting. The course will include visits to museums and collections in Boston and other locations in the New England area.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-81-02

We will examine Confucian phisophy and how Confucian ideas shaped the social hierarchy, gender roles, and aesthetic values through exploration of the architecture of royal palaces and aristocratic houses, paintngs both sacred and secular, ceramics, textiles and other crafts. Use of colors, symbolic motifs, and stories in the arts and cultures will be investigated.

Art History,ARTH,83.02,"Contemporary Art: Disaster, War and the Ethics of Witnessing","This seminar focuses on the relationship between lens-based media and moments of catastrophe in order to think creatively about how both operate pictorally. What constitutes the category of catastrophe—as opposed to crisis, war, etc.—and how does that category structure but also exceed photographic representation? We will look at photographs and films that bear witness to massacres, genocides and terrorist attacks. Some of the case studies include Auschwitz, Hiroshima, Apartheid South Africa, the Vietnam War, the Palestinian Nakba, the Cambodian Genocide and the Lebanese Civil War. We will also look at the role images play in documenting more recent events such as the Gulf War, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, the 2011 earthquake in Fukushima, the Syrian Civil War and the European migrant crisis. Readings will take us through photographic history, critical theory, and art history. Our study will conclude in considering how artist themselves have theorized the place and purpose of photography and film in historical catastrophes.\\\\u2028Underlying the arc of our study are three interrelated categories of questions. These concern: 1) the relationship of aesthetics to ethics and politics; 2) the relationship of those models of visuality and visibility to subaltern ways of understanding history 3) the ways in which art relates to questions of alterity and agency, which is to say how art might speak to without speaking for the victims of catastrophy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-83-02

Art History,ARTH,83.05,Advanced Seminar: Art and the Law,"This Advanced Seminar addresses legal issues that pertain to the sale, acquisition, display, ownership, and destruction of works of art. The topic is framed around two related questions: How does the special status of art, as a privileged sphere of creative expression, grant it different treatment under the law? What are some of the exemptions, protections, or obligations that are accorded to art that are not extended to other forms of personal property? The first part of the course will focus on case studies in which legal questions are entangled with ethical and political concerns: illicit international trade in looted art, repatriation claims, high-profile forgeries, and new guidelines for authentication. The second half looks at the legal framework that governs artists’ rights (including resale royalties, copyright, and freedom of expression) as well as the rules that structure transactions in the primary (e.g. artist-dealer contracts and handshake agreements) and secondary art markets. We will also analyze problems related to the representation of artists’ estates, the acquisition and de-accessioning of artworks by museums, and the tax codes associated with charitable contributions of works of art. Finally, the class considers how artists strategically make use of the unique affordances of the law and test what it is that artworks can do outside the circumscribed domain of the art world.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Art-History/ARTH-Art-History/ARTH-83-05

"Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages",ASCL,1.01,Urban Asia,"Asian cities, once considered to be recipients or followers of urban models imposed by Western cities, have become new models of urbanism themselves, thereby serving as the heart of the growing body of scholarship which focuses on such dynamic urban processes reshaping cities across the globe. For instance, over the last few decades, Singapore, Shanghai, and Seoul have distinguished themselves as points of reference for other aspiring cities in and beyond Asia. How have Asian cities transformed in an interconnected global economy? How does an interdisciplinary reading of Asian cities provide ways to think anew about Asia today?
            With Asia at the center of our urban inquiries, this course proposes to read Asian cities from historical and comparative perspectives. The primary purpose of this course is to introduce students to multiple disciplinary approaches to Asia’s urban environments and their dynamic relationships to other parts of the world.

The pursuit of this theme will take the student through a wide variety of Chinese literary genres and materials, including the classics, poetry, fiction, drama, biography, and law. The use of women as a focus in the organization of the course provides the selectivity that makes such comprehensiveness possible. The aim is to provide the student with an intimate portrait of the development of Chinese culture as a whole through the examination of one of its central systems. The course is designed with the presumption that an understanding of Chinese thoughts about women will lead to an enhanced understanding of Chinese thoughts about Chinese people and life in general.

At the moment, the frontier space beyond the Great Wall takes up more than half of the entire Chinese territory. The ways Chinese people deal with their ethnic minority regions, differentiate the northerners and the southerners, view their own culture and cultural others and imagine their regional and global roles can all be related to the spatial conceptions with regard to the frontier in pre-modern China. This course will trace the development of these conceptions through a variety of philosophical, cosmological, religious, historical, geographical, and literary texts and images. Classical Chinese texts however are not categorized by discipline but represent a body of interdisciplinary knowledge that reflects the culture’s thoughts and values. The course will deal with the materials in a way that relive their a-disciplinary nature while maintaining a critical perspective on them. When relevant, the course will also examine broader theoretical issues such as political morality, gender and sexuality, and border-crossing.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Asian-Societies-Cultures-and-Languages/ASCL-Asian-Societies-Cultures-and-Languages/ASCL-60-03

Thus the poetry-calligraphy-painting “Three Perfections” represents certain significant aspects of the Chinese culture. Since none of the “Three Perfections” is possible beyond the intellectual context of Chinese philosophy, and also, since the traditional Chinese painting has to be written (in the way of Chinese calligraphy) rather than painted, the Chinese painting/calligraphy, poetry, and philosophy are indeed the key for understanding the Chinese culture. By introducing the basics of traditional Chinese painting/calligraphy, classical Chinese poetry, Chinese cosmology, philosophy and religions, this course is the gateway to the Chinese manuscript culture that defines the written tradition of the Chinese culture. The first-hand experience of basic brush-and-ink techniques of traditional Chinese shuhua (calligraphy and painting) provides the student with visual and enjoyable illustrations of the relationship between traditional Chinese art and cosmology.

In the latter half of the term, we will also explore the layers of complexity embedded in the writing systems of these three nations.

In order to consider the multiple perspectives of the body across time, the readings are organized thematically, covering topics from physical beauty as virtue/vice, symbolic meanings of hair and clothing, aesthetics of the Tale of Genji, to disfigurement, disability, aging, race, among other things.

"Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages",ASCL,70.02,East Meets West,"This class explores the interaction between the cultures of East Asia and the West from as early as c. 200 BCE to the early 20th century. The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world’s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have “the Pottery War” and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters’ on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes. This course requires no previous experience, but is intended for those who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and culture.

Students should develop a thesis proposal in consultation with a prospective advisor. The primary advisor for an honors thesis must be an ACSL affiliated faculty member. Secondary advisors drawn from ASCL or other departments and programs are encouraged when the student’s project warrants additional expertise. Proposal guidelines can be found on the ASCL website.

If insufficient progress has been made on the thesis, students will be dropped from the program and given a grade for the work completed in the first term. The grade can count toward the ASCL major but not as a substitute for the ASCL Culminating Experience. A public presentation of the honors thesis at the end of the second term is a requirement of the Honors program. Completion of both ASCL 90 and 91 replace the ASCL culminating experience.

Biological Sciences - Undergraduate,BIOL,23,Social Evolution: Cooperation and Construction Among Animal Architects,"For the evolution of social life, cooperation raises a fundamental problem. Indeed, Darwin regarded cooperation as one of the greatest puzzles for his theory of evolution. If natural selection favors individuals that selfishly maximize their own reproductive success, then why should organisms cooperate at all? Yet evidence for cooperation is ubiquitous in many social animals, from insects to humans. This course will explore how and why cooperation evolves, with the goal of understanding general ecological and evolutionary principles, especially the conditions under which social organisms work together to help one another despite competition and conflicting interests. A central theme of the course will be cases of cooperation in which social animals architecturally construct their surroundings, by building long-lasting shelters.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Biological-Sciences/BIOL-Biological-Sciences-Undergraduate/BIOL-23

Biological Sciences - Undergraduate,BIOL,63,RNA: The Real Secret of Life,"Legend has it that after the discovery of the structure of DNA Francis Crick announced to the patrons of the Eagle Pub in Cambridge, England that they had discovered the secret of life.  But what has been learned since this February day in 1953 is that although DNA is the bedrock of modern molecular biology, it is actually RNA that allowed for the emergence of life, and is the central molecule in life’s Central Dogma.  Indeed, with the application of new deep sequencing technologies we are discovering that much of the genome is transcribed into functional RNA that does not code for proteins, but instead is involved in gene regulation and genomic architecture, in addition to the maintenance of genome integrity and even possibly the evolution of morphological complexity. In fact, the very question of “what is a gene?” is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomic organization appears not to be the classical DNA-based “gene” but instead is the RNA-based transcript.  In this course we will explore these issues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-led presentations, and student writing assignments.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Biological-Sciences/BIOL-Biological-Sciences-Undergraduate/BIOL-63

Classics - Classical Studies; Greek; Latin,CLST,10.06,The Concept of Love in Roman Literature,"This course explores the importance of love as a concept in the ancient Roman literary imagination. Vergil’s famous phrase “love conquers all” (omnia uincit amor, Eclogues 10.69) encapsulates the centrality of amor to the poetic genre of elegy. But the notion of love as a conquering force also hints at its ability to overwhelm, subdue, and destroy. The idea of love, broadly conceived, is embedded in the literature, philosophy, scientific thought, religion, and art and archaeology of the Romans. We will explore love in its various forms – devotion, lust, physical sexuality, friendship, and familial bonds – by looking at the central authors and genres of the Latin literary tradition (in English translation). Our discussion of these core texts will be further enriched by an examination of additional ancient sources, including Greek and Roman visual art, monuments and architecture, coins, and inscriptions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Classics-Classical-Studies-Greek-Latin/CLST-Classical-Studies/CLST-10-06

In this course we will investigate these questions by reading ancient Greek and Roman jokes, comedies, and satire alongside modern analyses of humor from psychology, sociology, and cognitive theory. Special themes to be discussed will include laughter and power, irony and satire in philosophy, visual humor, gallows humor, humor and horror, and laughing at others in terms of gender, ethnicity, race, and social class.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Classics-Classical-Studies-Greek-Latin/CLST-Classical-Studies/CLST-10-08
Classics - Classical Studies; Greek; Latin,CLST,10.09,Quantitative Literary Criticism,"Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies.

Classics - Classical Studies; Greek; Latin,CLST,10.12,The End of the World: Jewish and Christian Apocalyptic Literature in the Hellenistic Era,"The Hellenistic era was a period of remarkable theological and literary creativity within the Jewish and Christian communities, including the development of a unique genre, apocalyptic literature. Apocalyptic texts, which portend a catastrophic end to the world, are notoriously difficult to interpret due to their use of fantastical imagery and often cryptic symbolism.  In this class we will explore several texts in depth, including portions of Daniel from the Hebrew scriptures, the Book of Enoch from the Maccabean period, the Apocalypse of John (Revelation) from the Christian scriptures, and the 2nd century Christian text Apocalypse of Peter. In addition to learning how to read apocalyptic literature, we will examine the socio-historical context of these texts, their relationship to communities under duress and how they have been reimagined by later generations.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Classics-Classical-Studies-Greek-Latin/CLST-Classical-Studies/CLST-10-12

Classics - Classical Studies; Greek; Latin,CLST,11.03,Early Sparta and Corinth: A Comparative Approach to the Archaeohistory of Two Major Greek City-State,"This course centers on Sparta and Corinth, two city-states that, despite close geographic proximity, followed notably different developmental trajectories during the Archaic period. Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinth’s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks’ earliest large-scale stone temples. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during the Archaic period.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Classics-Classical-Studies-Greek-Latin/CLST-Classical-Studies/CLST-11-03

Did virgins get to heaven faster than those who marry? Can a chaste man and woman live together without succumbing to lust? Were men holier than women? What about women who behaved like men?

Classics - Classical Studies; Greek; Latin,CLST,11.07,Slave Societies Ancient and Modern: Imperial Rome and Brazil,"Although slavery has existed in virtually all cultures, scholars of comparative world slavery haveidentified only five societies in all of human history as ""slave societies"": two were in the ancientworld (classical Athens, Rome) and three were in the New World (the American South, theCaribbean, Brazil). This course examines slave systems in the ancient and modern worldscomparatively, focusing on Rome and Brazil. In Rome, the emergence of the state, including thedevelopment of the concept of the citizen, coincided with the development of the slave society.African slavery in Brazil was introduced soon after the establishment of the colonial governmentand drew heavily from classical legal definitions. In this course we compare the social andpolitical structures of these two slave systems (high art, popular culture, institutions). Weexamine how each slave society was legitimated, perpetuated-and ultimately challenged.Specific topics include: the construction of the slave and the emergence of racializing discourse,the slave trade and the commodification of the body, trickster narratives, modern theories ofpower and domination, resistance and rebellion, and the problem of freedom for previouslydominated peoples. Through comparison, students will not only become aware of the similaritiesbetween these two slave societies, but will also be better equipped to evaluate their uniquequalities and particular achievements.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Classics-Classical-Studies-Greek-Latin/CLST-Classical-Studies/CLST-11-07

This course surveys stories of deployment and return from antiquity to the present, to think about the genre of the war story, and especially to think about the self-fashioning narratives of individuals who have witnessed the realities of war and return home. Through close reading we examine the interactions of the returning soldier with his community, and the kinds of stories that soldiers will and will not tell. The historical, cross-cultural study of war stories allows the problem of homecoming to emerge more clearly as problems of the human condition across cultures and political or social organizations, the problem of homecoming emerges as a product of war.

In part two, we will explore the history of democracy at ancient Athens, with an emphasis on the development and functioning of democratic institutions, democratic ideology, and the exploitation by democracies of women, slaves, and foreigners. In part three, we will consider democracies outside Athens, as well as non-democratic regime types, such as oligarchy, tyranny, and the “Lycurgan” constitution at Sparta. In part four, we will turn our attention to the modern era.

During this period, the Roman empire (signifying the territorial extent conquered by Roman armies and administered by Roman officials) became a political community extending throughout the Mediterranean and northwards into Europe as far as Scotland. This course considers the logic of the Roman system: the mechanisms promoting the political identity of diverse peoples as Roman, and the endurance of local traditions within the Roman world; the reasoning whereby the overarching leadership of a single individual was conceived as necessary and good, and the evolving relationship between the princeps and the Roman senatorial aristocracy with a tradition of competitive participation and self identity in politics at Rome; the definition of the Roman frontiers and the role of the army in the assimilation of non-Roman peoples.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Classics-Classical-Studies-Greek-Latin/CLST-Classical-Studies/CLST-18

In this course, particular attention is paid to the material cultural achievements of the richest and artistically most influential of these poleis, the city of Athens, when that city developed the western world's first democracy, built the Parthenon, and played host to the schools established by Plato and Aristotle.

Discussion focuses on how ancient Italic traditions were transformed to suit the needs of the Imperial government (for example, the adaptation of the Republican, Hellenized Domus to the Imperial Palatia). The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult. Site analysis will stress the need for an imperial idiom, the accommodation of urban masses and the promotion of a sense of a shared cultural experience.

For example: how should we understand normative language that seems to be fundamentally about prescribing ways of acting, rather than about describing reality? Are moral judgments more a matter of emotion, or of belief? Can we reconcile a commitment to moral objectivity with our best scientific understanding of moral thought and talk? This course will engage such questions from a fundamentally interdisciplinary perspective, engaging with work from philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. In so doing, we will explore how empirical work can inform philosophical inquiry, and how philosophical inquiry can continue to guide ongoing research in the cognitive sciences.

Particular relevance will be put on the neural systems for representation of person knowledge.  In addition to weekly readings, students will have a written exam at the end of the course.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Cognitive-Science/COGS-Cognitive-Science/COGS-11-04
Cognitive Science,COGS,11.05,Moral Psychology,"Moral psychology is the interdisciplinary study of human moral cognition. Philosophers have long theorized the nature of moral judgment from the armchair. Now psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists are investigating hypotheses about how our brains make ethical decisions in the lab. In this class, we will read, and bring together in conversation, classic and cutting edge work from philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences on the nature of moral cognition. Topics include: Are moral judgments essentially emotional? Or is moral thought a species of reason? Can moral beliefs, by themselves, motivate us to action? Or must a background desire to do the right thing be involved? Is all human motivation, by its nature, self-interested? Or is genuine altruism possible? And should empirical findings about the neurobiological and evolutionary bases of our moral intuitions lead us, as some have argued, to reject certain philosophical moral theories – Kantianism, say – in favor of others – Utilitarianism – or not?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Cognitive-Science/COGS-Cognitive-Science/COGS-11-05

College Courses,COCO,19,Early Sparta and Corinth: A Comparative Approach to the Archaeohistory of Two Major Greek City-State,"This course centers on Sparta and Corinth, two city-states that, despite close geographic proximity, followed notably different developmental trajectories during the Archaic period. Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinth’s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks’ earliest large-scale stone temples. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during the Archaic period.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/College-Courses/COCO-College-Courses/COCO-19

College Courses,COCO,21,What's in Your Shoebox? Unpacking Your Study Abroad Experience,"Cultural anthropologist Bruce La Brack uses the term ""shoeboxing” to describe what is often done with study abroad experiences: the entire experience is put in a mental ""shoebox,"" tucked away in the closet of the mind, taken out only rarely for periodic show-and-tell reminiscing. When we want to share stories about the time away or how we’ve changed, it can be hard to find folk who really want to listen. What’s in Your Shoebox? aims to rectify this. The class has two primary goals; 1) to provide you with the opportunity to revisit, unpack, and deeply reflect upon your recent study abroad experience, and 2) to identify creative, practical, and meaningful ways to apply this new knowledge and awareness.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/College-Courses/COCO-College-Courses/COCO-21

College Courses,COCO,23,The Language-Music Connection,"Language and music are universal components of human experience, so integral that they are often considered part of what defines us as humans. While we treat them as distinct phenomena, the overlap between the two is immense, structurally, neurologically, and culturally. Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated. Students will be taught by a master of the tradition, Mamadou Diabaté, to feel for themselves what it means to speak through an instrument.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/College-Courses/COCO-College-Courses/COCO-23

College Courses,COCO,30,Democracy - A Challenged Concept,"Three decades after the end of the cold war resurgent ultra-nationalism, parochial populism, white supremacy, anti-immigrant fervor, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and rabid misogyny undermine the stability and indefeasibility of European and American democracies. Commentators and scholars identify rampant capitalism, neoliberalism, globalization, and the untamed proliferation of new media as causes for the vulnerability democracies. While some consider the establishment of right-wing movements and politicians as expressions of a temporary populist phase or even the advent of a post-democratic age, others refer to white-supremacist attacks or the recurrence of KKK and neo-Nazi groups worldwide as harbingers of a new fascism. This course will discuss the central terms and concepts such as (illiberal) democracy, republicanism, neoliberalism, populism, or fascism, as well as (counter-) movements on both side such as the Tea Party, Alt-Right, the Brexit, as well as #MeToo, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter through a variety of artifacts, documentaries, movies, speeches, literary texts, news articles and theoretical debates.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/College-Courses/COCO-College-Courses/COCO-30
College Courses,COCO,31,"Mind, Language, and Morality","This course examines questions about the connection between mind, language, and normative domains such as morality, politics, and law. For example: how should we understand normative language that seems to be fundamentally about prescribing ways of acting, rather than about describing reality? Are moral judgments more a matter of emotion, or of belief? Can we reconcile a commitment to moral objectivity with our best scientific understanding of moral thought and talk? This course will engage such questions from a fundamentally interdisciplinary perspective, engaging with work from philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. In so doing, we will explore how empirical work can inform philosophical inquiry, and how philosophical inquiry can continue to guide ongoing research in the cognitive sciences. Students will be encouraged to work in interdisciplinary teams to create their own co-authored research.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/College-Courses/COCO-College-Courses/COCO-31
College Courses,COCO,32,The Art of Adaptation and Storytelling,"This theoretical and practice-based course is a study of the conversion of oral, historical and fictional narratives into stage drama, cinema and literary texts. Special attention will be given to the cultural and political implications of cross-generic transformation, formulaic conventions and concepts of “genre,” “crossover appeal” and “adaptation.” Throughout the term, the intersections of race, culture and economics will be regularly questioned. Black cultural storytelling in various mediums and genres will be examined to serve as a point of entry into discussion of cultural worldview and storytelling in order to aid and encourage students to explore the theories, concepts and practice of adaptation from multiple, diverse vantage points and areas of interest. Building upon the adaptations they created in the first half of the quarter, students begin translating their stories visually in the “production” phase of the course. They assess how emotional information is translated in the original form and invent new ways of translating this content in their new visual format. Final projects can be interactive stage pieces, video installations or films.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/College-Courses/COCO-College-Courses/COCO-32

Computer Science - Undergraduate,COSC,49.04,Concurrent Algorithms,"We consider problems where multiple processes have to coordinate their activities to accomplish a task. For an example, suppose that there are many sensing agents on an aircraft and each agent, based on its reading of the environment, has a recommendation on whether the aircraft should keep straight, turn left, or turn right.  Since different agents can have different recommendations, we would want a protocol by which they can arrive at an ""agreement"" on whether the plane should go left, right, or straight.  How hard is it to design such a protocol? It turns out that if you want the protocol to be fault-tolerant, i.e., the protocol works correctly even if one of the agents stops communicating, it is impossible to design a correct protocol (under certain reasonable assumptions about the system).
In the course, we will look at several fascinating coordination problems and solve them for several models of distributed computing: shared-memory versus message passing, synchronous versus asynchronous, fault-free versus fault-tolerant. We design algorithms, and prove lower bounds or even impossibility results.
There will be weekly homework and a final exam.

While case studies are certainly familiar from tv series or podcasts, the form has a rich literary history. We will survey works from a range of national traditions, examining the features of the case that enable it to operate in and across multiple genres and fields. Our discussions will center on questions of epistemology and form, as we ask what kind of knowledge cases transmit and how they transmit it. Do they depict exceptional phenomena, or do they seek to delineate the qualities that are representative of a given phenomenon? Who has the authority to tell stories about whom?

Comparative Literature - Undergraduate,COLT,52.05,"On Survivors, Memories, and Tombs: State Violence in South America through Literature and Cinema","In the 1960s and 1970s, South America experienced a new cycle of state violence perpetrated by military dictatorships. The authoritarian regimes installed in Brazil (1964-85), Uruguay (1973-85), Chile (1973-90) and Argentina (1976-83) caused deep ruptures in collective and individual lives and still resonate in the South American political, social and cultural landscapes. After the democratic systems were reestablished in the region, new facts about the abuse of power by the militaries were disclosed, and a heated debate took place in the public sphere about how to deal with the past. Feature films, documentaries, and fiction and non-fiction literature played an essential role in that debate by providing different strategies of healing scars, honoring victims and survivors, and preserving the memory of both the terror and the grassroots resistance. The experiences and memories of the so-called ""dirty war"" in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay generated not only several fictional renderings of state terrorism during the ""years of lead,"" but also a whole series of testimonios by those directly affected by it, such as the daughters, sons and spouses of desaparecidos who were assassinated by the machinery of state repression.
This class focuses on the legacies of dictatorships in South America and the politics and aesthetics of representation of state violence and political resistance. Students will be introduced to central concepts of memory and trauma studies and will conduct comparative literary and cinematic analyses of works by Latin American writers and film directors.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-52-05
Comparative Literature - Undergraduate,COLT,52.07,"Beyond Sex, Drugs, and Rock ‘n Roll: Radical Latinxs in the 60’s","The 1960s and 70s were a time of tremendous political and creative turmoil in the US in general and for Latinos in particular. Joining in the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-Vietnam mobilization, Latinos also fought for their rights founding important political organizations such as the Raza Unida Party; MeCHA, the United Farm Workers, the Brown Berets, the Nuyorican Young Lords Party, among many others. Beyond traditional stereotypes of the 60s as the period of drugs, sex and rock ‘n roll, protesters and political activists were inordinately adept at creating and mobilizing artistic symbols, music, and literature to promote their agenda. We will study the creation of Aztlán as an imaginary Chicano homeland in the Southwest; works of individual Latino artists and writers; important journals (Con Safos, Chismearte, Arte del Varrio); organizations such as the Royal Chicano Air Force, Asco, Galería de la Raza, the Teatro Campesino, the Nuyorican Poets’ Café; national monuments such as Chicano Park; and exhibitions such as Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA; held at UCLA).

We will consider several permutations of the relationship of music and language, and especially inspect the fringes, where a listener may say “this is no longer music” or “this is no longer speech.”  Does music without a text in fact always have a text? What happens to poems when they become songs or prose plots when they become opera?  Conversely, are there stories that incorporate music or are composed according to a musical form?  In your writing, you may choose musical examples that suit your tastes and expertise; and you will devise and write a final paper of your choice.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-60-01
Comparative Literature - Undergraduate,COLT,61.01,Art Writing and Writers on Art,"This course will explore the various modes of writing on or about art and artists from the early modern to the modern period in Europe. Focusing primarily on writers and texts from France, Germany and Italy, we will consider the social and cultural roles of the artist and art works as they were formulated, investigated and reinterpreted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The classical revival and the beginnings of “modern” art history, the growth of the periodical press and the explosion of art (and literary) criticism, the growing public sphere for art, the biographical tendency in historical writing, and Romantic fantasies of the artist all worked to create a rich body of literary or quasi-literary writings on art and artists at this time.
 Many of the texts we will read were translated into other languages soon after their initial appearance, testifying to the international readership and scope of these writers and their works. The figure of the artist as developed in the 18th and 19th centuries only became more prominent in our cultural consciousness in the 20th century as Romanticism’s ideas of genius and the vanguard (often mad) artist and the separate sphere of the visual arts became entrenched in discourses of modernism. Exploring writings on art at this critical juncture in the beginnings of modernism can shed light on our continuing notions of what art is and has been, and on how art and artists have been described, understood, and fantasized about for centuries.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-61-01
Comparative Literature - Undergraduate,COLT,62.02,"Shades of Noir: Film, Fiction, Politics","“Film Noir” evokes memories of stylish, cynical, black-and-white movies from the 1940s and 1950s—melodramas about private eyes, femmes fatales, criminal gangs, and lovers on the run. In this course, we will examine noir in relation to its many contexts: the hard-boiled fiction of Chandler and Hammett; the experience of dislocation and alienation that reflect the exile status of many central-European professionals who worked in the US film industry in the 1940s; and Hollywood blacklisting and censorship during the anti-Communist witch hunt. The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world. Because of its artistic and political complexity, noir is a key term for the study of US postwar cultural history: noir narratives revolve around questions of racial and national identity, around the postwar crisis of masculinity, and the convergence of modernism and mass culture.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-62-02
Comparative Literature - Undergraduate,COLT,63.02,Modern Conspiracy: The Russian and American Conspiracist Traditions,"Conspiracy narrative has come to dominate our national and international political discourse like no other time in modern history. It is therefore essential that we understand the operation of conspiracy narrative, its psychological allure and political function, and its devastating social consequences. In this course, we will investigate two national conspiracist traditions, the American and the Russian, and the parallel rise and stunning convergence of Russian and American conspiracism in our current political moment. In order to do so, we will inquire into the historical origins, the form, function, and effectiveness of conspiracist narratives in these two traditions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ultimately we will approach conspiracy theories as ways of knowing, of penetrating and ordering complex and opaque realities. They are also powerful narrative weapons that imperil the shared truths on which cohesive societies are based. Our course texts include The Master and Margarita (Bulgakov), The Crucible (Miller), and Libra (DeLillo), Ivan the Terrible Part II (Eisenstein) The Manchurian Candidate (Frankenheimer) and The Matrix (The Wachkowskis) as well as literary and cultural studies of conspiracist narrative and ideation.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-63-02

In this course we will examine the main events connected with the Second World War, the genocide of European Jewry and Roma-Sinti, forced resettlements of various populations, and the Allied attacks on the German civilian population.  We will analyze the different stages of coming to grips with that past on the part of German and some other postwar societies, by examining together a number of controversies like those surrounding the Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Eichmann and Barbie trials, the campaign to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, Neonazism, the Wehrmacht photo exhibition, and the current campaign to remember German civilian casualties and losses.  Approaching our topic with interdisciplinary and comparative methodology, that is, by utilizing history, journalism, video testimony, music, literature, and art, including film, photography and architecture, students will develop their own perspectives on the formation of postwar German identity and why Nazis remain the epitome of evil. An individual midterm project will allow students to practice the skill of summarizing different sides of a debate, and a final group project will invite students to solidify what they have learned in the course about the formation of national identity by creatively staging a contemporary debate about the Nazi past.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-64-01

This course surveys stories of deployment and return from antiquity to the present, to think about the genre of the war story, and especially to think about the self-fashioning narratives of individuals who have witnessed the realities of war and return home. Through close reading we examine the interactions of the returning soldier with his community, and the kinds of stories that soldiers will and will not tell. The historical, cross-cultural study of war stories allows the problem of homecoming to emerge more clearly as problems of the human condition across cultures and political or social organizations, the problem of homecoming emerges as a product of war. Texts may include Homer, Odyssey; Remarque, The Road Back; S. Ooka, Fires on the Plain; Tim O’Brien, The Things They Carried; Bao Ninh, The Sorrow of War: A Novel of North Vietnam; D.

Comparative Literature - Undergraduate,COLT,66.02,Literature and Psychoanalysis: The Cultural Legacy of Sigmund Freud,"Those new to Freud might be surprised by the role of literature in his texts. Why, for instance, are Hamlet and Oedipus so important in articulating theories of the psyche? Why might a medical practitioner analyze novels in addition to analyzing patients? Our goals for this course are twofold: First, we will work to understand Freud’s texts on their own terms as we familiarize ourselves with psychoanalytic theories. Second, we will situate these works within a broader cultural context, reading them alongside literary texts that Freud explicitly addresses and alongside literary, filmic, and theoretical works that draw on psychoanalytic concepts. Our discussions of the cultural imprint of Freudian thought will encompass a variety of themes, from gender and sexuality to Jewishness to the clinical techniques central to psychoanalytic practice. We will grapple with the promises and limitations of Freud’s own literary “archive” and the cultural products that archive Freudian thought.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-66-02

In this class, students will be introduced to the relatively new field of ecologically oriented literary and cultural studies. We will critically engage with various cultural constructions of environmental concepts and practices in a range of artworks exemplifying different discourses of nature (e.g. mythological, philosophical, scientific) and media (e.g. literature, cinema, land art, music, etc.). We will thus explore how an artwork can convey narratives of environmental resistance and ecological liberation as well as embody the historical continuity between human communities and specific territories. In addition, consideration will be given to the emergence of a number of distinct approaches within the Environmental Humanities, such as critical ecofeminism, biosemiotics, environmental justice, critical animal studies, new materialism, and posthumanism.
We will thus include in our class the rewarding practices of observation, hands-on experimentation, and skill-building perspectives, as well as try as much as possible to move beyond the classroom and embrace the world as an ideal learning space.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Comparative-Literature/COLT-Comparative-Literature-Undergraduate/COLT-70-05

Environmental Studies Program,ENVS,60,Environmental Law,"Environmental law aims to protect and enhance the environment, reduce the risk to human health from pollution, and achieve sustainable development of natural resources. The success of environmental law depends upon balancing the three components of sustainability: ecological, economic, and social/cultural. Today, the primary sources of this balancing act are federal, state, and local ordinances and their myriad regulations. However, these statutes and regulations overlay a common, judge-made, law of property that establishes a system of private and public property, a law of contracts that governs transactions, and a tort law that provides remedies for intentional and unintentional harms. In addition, there is a growing body of international environmental law with both similarities and differences to U.S. environmental law. The major objectives of this course are to survey today's major environmental laws, explore their history, determine how well they balance ecological, economic, and social sustainability and, finally, to discuss how to improve environmental law to better deal with biodiversity loss, human population growth, energy needs, and climate change in the future. Enrollment is limited.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Environmental-Studies-Program/ENVS-Environmental-Studies/ENVS-60

Environmental Studies Program,ENVS,79,The Soil Resource,"Soils are a critical natural resource; feeding our growing population depends fundamentally on soils; in fact, soils provide nutrients to all ecosystems. Agriculture and land management has increased soil erosion around the world, potentially influencing the history and fate of civilizations. In the modern era, this use is not sustainable; the physical and chemical degradation of soils far outpaces soil production. This course will explore the nature and properties of soils and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource. We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties. The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems. The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Environmental-Studies-Program/ENVS-Environmental-Studies/ENVS-79

Regenerative design is a systems-theory based approach to design. “Regenerative” processes restore energy used and materials consumed through a closed loop model where the outputs are equal to the inputs where waste=resources. Through this process, social needs are addressed while diminishing ecological impact, and usable energy, food and additional materials are created instead of waste and the designed system can actually improve the natural environment over time.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Environmental-Studies-Program/ENVS-Environmental-Studies/ENVS-80-03

Environmental Studies Program,ENVS,80.10,Coupled Human-Natural Systems: Theory and Practice,"This course is an introduction to coupled human-natural systems, exploring how social, ecological, and environmental systems are linked and feedback to influence each other. Increasing human demand for Earth’s limited resources has resulted in a plethora of hazards to the natural world; problems which are unlikely to be solved without understanding the links between human and natural systems. Here, we will explore some of the complex, sometimes non-intuitive behavior that results from coupling these systems. The primary objective is to introduce students to the tools and techniques of complex systems science used for researching coupled human-natural systems. In a series of lectures and computer laboratory modules, students will be introduced to significant areas of research in the field and learn how to analyze and leverage basic continuous and discrete time differential models and spatiotemporal statistics to address socio-ecological problems. The course will provide basic coding instruction, as necessary. No prior experience in coding is needed. In a final project, students will work in groups to develop or adapt an existing socio-ecological model, gather and analyze existing data, as well as interpret the implications of their results for human management.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Environmental-Studies-Program/ENVS-Environmental-Studies/ENVS-80-10

Latinx audiences have long been an interest and target of the Hollywood studios. Since the beginning of sound in film, the studios grappled with reaching this linguistically and culturally-diverse demographic. Since the late 20th century, the studios have widely acknowledged the box office power of that group. Time and again, however, the Hollywood industry has failed to accurately identify and engage Latinx peoples on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Through a variety of readings and screenings of films and TV shows, we will be examining American downtowns, suburbs, and homes as sites for the construction of classed, racialized, sexualized and gendered identities in three different time periods: the early 20th century, the post WWII era, and the contemporary period. We will interrogate such topics as: the real and imagined role of “shopping” women and gender in the shaping of modern downtowns; the relationship between the American suburb, new sexual identities and the film Pillow Talk; and how a particular nostalgia for the past that has led to the popularity of such shows as Mad Men can also be seen on the streets of Hanover (neo-traditional urbanism).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Film-and-Media-Studies/FILM-Film-and-Media-Studies/FILM-47-21

The course will examine several of the most significant areas that were influenced by this vital cultural shift: the American academy and intellectual life; the film industry (“Weimar on the Pacific,” as Hollywood was sometimes called); and, more generally, the political and cultural debates concerning the “German Question,” i.e., what to do with Germany after the war.

These fundamental social constructs in American life have been central to the development of American film narrative from the beginnings of cinema at the turn of the twentieth century. In turn, American films have profoundly shaped the ways that we think about race and gender and racialized and gendered beings. We will analyze the shifting and situational meanings of race and gender throughout the twentieth century, and in particular, how they have been influenced by the forces of history, including wars, economic depressions, and social movements. While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the “golden age”, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present. In our consideration of race and racialized peoples, we will include African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos.

We will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing our reading assignments from the fields of Ethnic Studies, American Studies, Performance Studies, and Film and Media Studies, in order to analyze these productions as they traveled from stage to screen (and sometimes, back to the stage) and the representational and cultural politics involved in that shift. Finally, we will explore not only the musicals themselves, but also the historiography that has informed our understanding of them.

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,FREN,80.03,Men Behaving Badly:  The Offending Sex in Literature and Music,"Infamous men are often portrayed in works of art and literature as predatory and power hungry narcissists. From Don Juan’s sexual predation, to Valmont’s narcissism, the evils of men are, at once, the most reviled and the most seductive to artists and audiences alike. This course will explore the historical progression of “bad-boy” behavior through the literary and musical works of Berlioz, Molière, Laclos and others. We will study miscreants who single-mindedly pursue their destructive goals. By examining how literature and music represent misogyny, we will pay particular attention to what constitutes “bad” behavior, to what initiates such behavior, and to the moral and social implications of such behavior. At the same time, we will discuss how the “good” aesthetics of “bad” (the way in which aesthetic beauty) is made from the raw materials of social and psychological malefaction. These broader questions will help frame our thematic investigation of misbehavior, with discussions on vices such as rakishness, hubris, greed and narcissism. We will focus on how literary and musical genres portray these vices, and then take note of how vices attain an ambiguous meaning within the social and moral systems of these works.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/FREN-French/FREN-80-03

Color was omnipresent, whether in interior or exterior paintings, in sacred or secular architecture, in sculpture, furniture or illustrated manuscripts.  A church was not considered complete until it had been painted. Mural paintings adorned with narrative scenes or decorative figures sought to embellish God's earthly Creation; to paint was to undertake a spiritual endeavor.   At the same time, color and images aimed to teach; no scene or figure was without meaning.  From the walls of medieval edifices to the pages of manuscripts, we will explore in this seminar pictorial creation in France from the seventh through the fifteenth centuries.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/FREN-French/FREN-80-04

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,FRIT,33.01,Into and Beyond Dante's Inferno -,"The work of Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) stages from beginning to end a struggle between personal desire, social obligation, and the conflicting cultures of Christian religion and the body politic. The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,FRIT,37.01,Nature: A Literary History,"Civilization's essence lies in its distinction from Nature. Both physically and symbolically, city walls separate the world of citizens, societies, and cultures from the uncultivated land, the wild beasts, and the illiterate savages that lie without. But how solid are these walls? And how real or even desirable are the distinctions they seek to make? We may prefer the civilized to the wild, but do we not also, paradoxically, prefer the natural to the artificial? Is nature to be dominated, or revered? Is it our nemesis or our mother? Exploring texts in the Italian tradition, this course will trace the history of nature from the beginning of civilization to the present time, and uncover our ever changing, ever contradictory opinions about it.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/FRIT-French-and-Italian-in-Translation/FRIT-37-01

Although combatting racial inequality and white supremacy is generally understood through the lens of movements in the US, or the example of South African apartheid, this course invites students to consider such undertakings from a fundamentally transnational point of view by focusing on Black Feminisms in the French-speaking African diaspora.

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,FRIT,37.04,Magic Italy: Italian Fairy Tales in the European Context,"The fairy tale is among the oldest and most enduring forms of narrative, a prototype of how we tell stories and of how we reflect on our human condition. Fairy tales are uniquely “in” and “out” of the world; their matter-of-fact mash-up of realistic and fantastic elements is an invitation to imagine dimensions different from the here-and-now. As such, they are a potent vehicle for the expression of cultural aspirations and anxieties as well as for the construction and subversion of ideologies and identities.
This course is a study of the rich and precocious Italian fairy-tale tradition, the very first to take literary form in Europe. Along the way we will address questions concerning canon formation; the role of “marvelous” genres such as the fairy tale in socialization and the expression of national identity; the relation between oral folk narratives and written literary tales; and the reworking of fairy-tale subjects and motifs in contemporary culture. We will also acquaint ourselves with a variety of critical approaches to the fairy tale, and consider some of the other European fairy-tale traditions, especially the French and the German.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/FRIT-French-and-Italian-in-Translation/FRIT-37-04

Drawing on archival research, critical theory and speculative fiction from Black queer and trans thinkers such as Miss Major, Edouard Glissant, Marie Vieux-Chauvet, Octavia Butler, and Samuel Delany, our goal will be to challenge our current carceral order, chart how we move past it, and imagine what liberatory prison abolitionist futures lie beyond.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/FRIT-French-and-Italian-in-Translation/FRIT-37-05

The United States has always figured heavily in the collective French imaginary ever since the American Revolution, for instance in the works of Tocqueville and Chateaubriand. American literature, however, gains particular prominence toward the mid-twentieth century with the transatlantic travels of Simone de Beauvoir, André Breton, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Philippe Sollers among authors, to the point that French writers began wondering how one can even be French in the first place. The course explores this crisis in national identity through a series of important poetic Franco-American friendships and collaborations: Edmond Jabès and Rosmarie Waldrop; Emmanuel Hocquard and Michael Palmer; Serge Pey and Allen Ginsberg; the Fondation Royaumont; the poetry collective double change; among others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/FRIT-French-and-Italian-in-Translation/FRIT-37-08

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,ITAL,27.01,Animals and Animality in Modern Italian Literature and Thought,"With the modernization of their country, Italian authors have been increasingly interested in animals, using representations of non-human creatures to reflect upon themselves and their changing relationships with the environment. This course focuses on modern Italian literary and philosophical texts (from Leopardi’s Operette Morali to Agamben’s L’aperto) which strongly feature non-human animals and animality, in order to explore how modern Italian culture offers an original contribution to the re-thinking of the limits of anthropocentric humanism.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/ITAL-Italian/ITAL-27-01

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,ITAL,33.01,Into and Beyond Dante's Inferno -,"The work of Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) stages from beginning to end a struggle between personal desire, social obligation, and the conflicting cultures of Christian religion and the body politic. The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

Both physically and symbolically, city walls separate the world of citizens, societies, and cultures from the uncultivated land, the wild beasts, and the illiterate savages that lie without. But how solid are these walls? And how real or even desirable are the distinctions they seek to make? We may prefer the civilized to the wild, but do we not also, paradoxically, prefer the natural to the artificial? Is nature to be dominated, or revered? Is it our nemesis or our mother? Exploring texts in the Italian tradition, this course will trace the history of nature from the beginning of civilization to the present time, and uncover our ever changing, ever contradictory opinions about it.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/ITAL-Italian/ITAL-37-01

Although combatting racial inequality and white supremacy is generally understood through the lens of movements in the US, or the example of South African apartheid, this course invites students to consider such undertakings from a fundamentally transnational point of view by focusing on Black Feminisms in the French-speaking African diaspora.

Drawing on archival research, critical theory and speculative fiction from Black queer and trans thinkers such as Miss Major, Edouard Glissant, Marie Vieux-Chauvet, Octavia Butler, and Samuel Delany, our goal will be to challenge our current carceral order, chart how we move past it, and imagine what liberatory prison abolitionist futures lie beyond.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/French-and-Italian-Languages-and-Literatures/ITAL-Italian/ITAL-37-05

French and Italian Languages and Literatures,ITAL,37.09,Italian Ecologies: Italy and the Environmental Humanities,"What can Italy teach us about our relationships with the nonhuman world in the current socio-environmental crisis?
In this course, we will focus on how Italian writers and activists, visual artists and philosophers engaged with real and fictional environments, and how their engagements reflect, critique, and animate the approach that Italian culture has had toward the physical environment and its ecology since late antiquity. Through a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, we will explore topics including climate change, environmental justice, animal ethics, and the potential relationships between socio-environmental degradation and epidemics. We will thus analyze how Italian ecological narratives fit within the current transnational debate occurring in the Environmental Humanities.
Our goal is to provide both an account of how Italian culture has shaped contemporary environmental thought and how Italian authors are presently developing unique ecological approaches to raise questions about the role of humans in a possible post-natural world.

Geography,GEOG,12,"Wilderness, Culture and Environmental Conservation","The purpose of this course is to describe and examine the manifold ways that environmental alterations have occurred - over both geologic and historical timescales. Considerable research over the past several decades has shown that anthropogenic disturbance has significantly modified natural processes frequently leading to degraded conditions. The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are ""natural"" and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change.

Geography,GEOG,30.01,Jews and Cities: Urban Encounter and Cultural Transformations,"The Jewish diasporic encounter in Europe took place almost entirely in an urban context. The legal, political and cultural framework of the European city shaped the trajectory of the Jews in a profound and lasting way, and cities and metropolises continue to shape Jewish civilization in many ways. From the Venetian ghetto to the Lower East Side, from the pletzl in Paris to the vast neighborhoods in the first Jewish metropolises in Eastern Europe, the different settings shaped Jewish civilization.
\fThis course proposes a close reading of this urban context: what were the legal and political foundations, how did Jews organize themselves in cities, what economic opportunities did they develop?

Geography,GEOG,80.04,Scenes from the City: Urbanism and Modern American Visual Culture,"From silent films to Mad Men, the American city has been the site through which “modern” identities have been imagined and created. This course draws on Cultural Geography and Film and Media Studies in order to interrogate this development. Through a variety of readings and screenings of films and TV shows, we will be examining American downtowns, suburbs, and homes as sites for the construction of classed, racialized, sexualized and gendered identities in three different time periods: the early 20th century, the post WWII era, and the contemporary period. We will interrogate such topics as: the real and imagined role of “shopping” women and gender in the shaping of modern downtowns; the relationship between the American suburb, new sexual identities and the film Pillow Talk; and how a particular nostalgia for the past that has led to the popularity of such shows as Mad Men can also be seen on the streets of Hanover (neo-traditional urbanism).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Geography/GEOG-Geography/GEOG-80-04

Geography,GEOG,80.07,"Race, Space, and Nature","Ideas of racial difference are frequently advanced as “natural” truths about the world, linked to normative conceptions of environmental relations. Reciprocally, racism—as a set of deadly ideological and material practices articulated around purported group differences—has profoundly shaped conceptions of non-human nature. This course asks how race is inflected in the politics and practices through which humans interact with the “natural” world, and explores the implications for contemporary movements and mobilizations for environmental justice.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Geography/GEOG-Geography/GEOG-80-07

German Studies,GERM,15,"Nazis, Neonazis, Antifa and the Others: Exploring Responses to the Nazi Past","Why do the Nazis remain the world’s epitome of evil? What did they actually do? And how specifically are they remembered, depicted, emulated, despised or ignored since the catastrophes of the mid-twentieth Century? In this course we will examine the main events connected with the Second World War, the genocide of European Jewry and Roma-Sinti, forced resettlements of various populations, and the Allied attacks on the German civilian population.  We will analyze the different stages of coming to grips with that past on the part of German and some other postwar societies, by examining together a number of controversies like those surrounding the Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Eichmann and Barbie trials, the campaign to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, Neonazism, the Wehrmacht photo exhibition, and the current campaign to remember German civilian casualties and losses.  Approaching our topic with interdisciplinary and comparative methodology, that is, by utilizing history, journalism, video testimony, music, literature, and art, including film, photography and architecture, students will develop their own perspectives on the formation of postwar German identity and why Nazis remain the epitome of evil. An individual midterm project will allow students to practice the skill of summarizing different sides of a debate, and a final group project will invite students to solidify what they have learned in the course about the formation of national identity by creatively staging a contemporary debate about the Nazi past.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-15

German Studies,GERM,42.04,From the Typewriter to Virtual Reality: Modern Media Theory (in English Translation),"The media theorist Friedrich Kittler famously declared, “Media determine our situation.” But what is a medium, and how can we understand its impact? Through analysis of foundational media-theoretical writings from the 20th and 21st centuries, this seminar will explore the relationship between modern media and fundamental cultural practices, ranging from the acoustic (gramophone, radio), to the visual (photography, film, virtual realities), to the tactile (typewriter, e-reader, touch screen). Topics will include the relationship between media technologies, perception, and communication; the interplay of mass media and art; and changing notions of reality. The seminar will emphasize the “German tradition” of media studies with its focus on technology and material media and put it in dialog with international developments (McLuhan, Baudrillard, Virilio, Parikka).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-42-04
German Studies,GERM,42.05,"Material Realities, Material Matters: A Brief History of Paper and Other Writing Surfaces","The age of paper is said to be over because so much data are digital now. Yet we are far from being a paperless society. Paper is still everywhere in our everyday lives (think money) and even in our language (“I have to write a term paper”). In this course, we will trace the media history of paper and other writing surfaces—from clay tablets, to papyrus, to Gutenberg’s letterpress, to the industrial age of newsprint, to the pdf—to find out how paper permeated modern culture and civilization as deeply as it did. Combining media-historical and literary readings, we will study the impact that paper had on literary and intellectual production. How might the choice of writing surface both enable and restrict the writer’s creative possibilities? Theoretical readings by McLuhan, Foucault, Kittler, and Johns; selected literary writings by de Pizane, Diderot and D’Alembert, Defoe, Lichtenberg, Dickens, George, and Sudjic.

shaped the perceptions of psychoanalysis as a specifically Jewish theory and practice.  Through
a reading of Freud’s texts on gender, sexuality, and religion, we will trace the connects between
psychoanalysis, Jewishness, and gender that have impacted theoretical discussion.  We will explore critique, including Horney, Reich, and Marcuse, and recent debate on the status of Freud in the U.S.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-42-06

Through role plays, experiential exercises, and analyses of case studies from the global industry and world politics students will learn about significant components of their own culture and other cultures.

German Studies,GERM,42.08,Mind Reading: Media and the Brain,"How do we know what someone else is thinking or feeling? How do we conceptualize how our own minds operate? We will look at representations of the mind and brain in a range of media, studying literary texts that deal thematically with physiognomic or psychoanalytic thought; innovations in narrative form that allowed for more direct access to the psyche; visual and filmic representations of the mind and brain; and recent empirical studies of literature.

German Studies,GERM,42.11,Literature and Psychoanalysis: The Cultural Legacy of Sigmund Freud,"Those new to Freud might be surprised by the role of literature in his texts. Why, for instance, are Hamlet and Oedipus so important in articulating theories of the psyche? Why might a medical practitioner analyze novels in addition to analyzing patients? Our goals for this course are twofold: First, we will work to understand Freud’s texts on their own terms as we familiarize ourselves with psychoanalytic theories. Second, we will situate these works within a broader cultural context, reading them alongside literary texts that Freud explicitly addresses and alongside literary, filmic, and theoretical works that draw on psychoanalytic concepts. Our discussions of the cultural imprint of Freudian thought will encompass a variety of themes, from gender and sexuality to Jewishness to the clinical techniques central to psychoanalytic practice. We will grapple with the promises and limitations of Freud’s own literary “archive” and the cultural products that archive Freudian thought.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-42-11

In this class, we study film as an aesthetic and political medium and explore how directors construct and deconstruct borders in their audience’s imagination. We analyze the concept of cinematic 'borderscapes' and examine how depictions of borders rely on narratives, images and imaginations. We do not only assess who is crossing international borders – commuters, tourists, immigrants, refugees, human traffickers and their victims – but we also examine who is welcome to cross, who is welcome to stay and who has to be expelled. We put German cosmopolitan road movies, tourist films and tales of successful and unsuccessful migration and integration in the context of global cinema and analyze differences in debates surrounding multiculturalism, migration and mobility, national identity and human rights.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-43

In our analysis of popular mainstream movies as well as low–budget independent productions, we will also address how filmmakers today refer to their rich tradition of German cinema before reunification, e.g. the Expressionist cinema of the 1920s or the New German Cinema of the 1970s.  No German knowledge is required for this class – all films are available and subtitled in English.  By special arrangement, this course can also  count toward a German Studies major or minor.  (in English Translation) Open to all Classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-43-01

This course concentrates on Marlowe's The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus, on Goethe's Faust, and on Mann's Doctor Faustus. It also considers Fausts in French and Russian Literature and in New England as well as in art, music, and film.

For inspiration they drew not on political thought or science, but on works of art, philosophy, and literature where nature—especially the forest—loomed large.

German Studies,GERM,46.02,"Kafka and Brecht: Alienation, Satire, and Revolt","Franz Kafka (1883-1924), the most influential prose writer of the 20th century, and BertoltBrecht (1898-1956), probably the most influential dramatist, both examine the alienated and un-heroic modern individual in her/his unhappy relationship to hostile social environments: dysfunctional families, impenetrable bureaucracies, heartless capitalist economies.

In few other writers do we find despair and hope, guilt and redemption, dream and reality, in such close proximity. Kafka expresses the struggles of the modern self through the labyrinth-like character of his prose, through which we as readers must find a path.

But it hasn’t always been this way. The German understanding of belonging has a long and complicated history that spans several centuries. In our readings and viewings, which will range from Nazi films to memoirs of GDR-born writers, we will trace this history’s twentieth-century course.

Discussions are based off of material from the Middle Ages to the Present and center on artistic  fantasies that involve social taboos including adultery, object-love, voyeurism, exhibitionism, prostitution, masturbation, sadomasochism, the art of pornography, same-sex love and age-difference relationships. We will situate each theme in its historical and literary context and investigate in what ways imagining sexual desires beyond the publicly acceptable may be read 1) as a call for non-conformism and rebellion against the repressive politics of the state exacted on the individual subject, 2) as a response against the psycho-medical field’s narrow labeling of sexual desires as degenerate perversions of middle class morals, 3) as cautionary tales that aim to redress such perceived acts of deviance and reestablish the moral order of the majority and 3) as artistic expression of that which is fundamentally human, i.e. the wide range of human sensory perception between the self and the other, which leads to such desires. The fictional material will be supplemented by medical, legal and political texts that seek to classify, regulate and fight for the expression of sexual relationships that are considered “beyond the norm.”",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/German-Studies/GERM-German-Studies/GERM-65-09

German Studies,GERM,82.05,Found in Translation: Humor in German Literature,"Humor is a funny thing—especially in German. Many German novels, plays, poems, and other texts show a sense of humor, ranging from amusing entertainment to social satire to documents of quasi-philosophical detachment. This seminar explores several such fictional, poetic, dramatic, and other texts, including some recently written by its instructor. It also links such texts to the practice of translation and thus treats not only literary issues but also lexical, semantic, cultural, and other related topics.

Not only will we talk about what sets one media apart from the other; the works by Wolfgang Borchert, Günter Grass, Christine Nöstlinger, Marcel Beyer, W.G.

Between the latter half of the 14th century through the late 18th century European society, economics, politics, ideas, and culture were altered in ways that increasingly took on aspects of modernity. From the aftermath of a pandemic crisis through a period punctuated by religious reformations, civil wars, and revolutionary regicides, Europeans steadily adopted more modern attitudes to property, authority, community, work, family, the body, nature, and supernatural forces.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-3-02

Throughout these 100 years, contrasting visions of a new society ushered in a range of different regimes—monarchical empires, liberal republics, murderous and racist dictatorships, Communist autocracies, and a democratic welfare states—yet these visions also led to the emancipation of women, the development of a new consumer society, the creation of environmentalist movements and new counter-cultures, and the transformation of everyday lives.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-3-03

History,HIST,4.03,Introduction to the Modern Middle East and North Africa,"The diverse nations and peoples that make up the Middle East and North Africa are of major significance in our contemporary world, at the same time that they are often misunderstood or given only superficial (albeit spectacular) popular attention. This lecture course is designed to give students a nuanced introductory overview of the modern histories of this region. Students will read a variety of primary and secondary materials designed to familiarize them with the historical, cultural, and social processes that have affected and transformed the region in question, and will learn to put these regional histories in a global framework.

As Korea matters to the US not simply as a fact but as a project, this course avoids portraying Korea through any generalized statements or uncritical categories.

History,HIST,10.03,The Dartmouth Vietnam Project: Learning Oral History in a Digital Age,"This course explores the theory and practice of oral history, a field in which historians conduct collaborative interviews with narrators to create new records of past events.  Oral history interviews are used to explore both the lives of individuals and the histories of communities.  In some cases, oral history provides a way to access voices and perspectives that are marginalized or absent from the materials contained in traditional archives. The use of oral history interviews as primary sources raises complex questions about narrative, subjectivity, memory, and historical truth.  In this course, students will not only learn and practice oral history interviewing, but also learn how to interpret and analyze the interviews they create.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-10-03

History,HIST,35,The Creation of 'America' in the Age of Jefferson,"The years between the close of the American Revolution and the start of the Age of Jackson have been described as the “most neglected, if not the most despised period of American history.” Without the drama of the Revolutionary years or the ominous tension of the Civil War’s approach, the Early Republic has been seen as a dull interval between the country’s defining events. Now, new methods in the study of American history have completely changed the way we understand the period. This course will focus on the seminal task of nation building, when distinctively American political parties, cities and villages, gender roles, educational systems, decorative arts, cultural institutions, attitudes toward Native peoples, architecture and economic policies took form. Thomas Jefferson actively shaped the debates over these issues, and he serves as the pivotal figure in our study of the formation of a new and specifically American culture in the Early Republican period.

History,HIST,38.03,Pan-Indianism in American History,"This course provides the history of pan-Indian movements in Indigenous North America from 1680 to the present. In the current era of self-determination, tribal sovereignty, and Indigenous nationhood, we perhaps sometimes forget that pan-Indian movements have played a significant part in the history and experiences of Native peoples of North America. We will explore the many ways in which Native peoples have aligned themselves with other tribal nations religious, military, educational, economic, and environmental movements, in the process cutting across linguistic, cultural, religious, and national lines. Indigenous North Americans have deployed pan-Indianism as a strategy to confront both international such as colonialism and the struggles for control of contested Borderlands, and more regional and localized forces.

History,HIST,38.04,Indigenous North American Borderlands,"This course focuses on the histories of Indigenous peoples in the borderlands of North America across time in both geographic and thematic contexts. Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-38-04

History,HIST,41.01,Empires and Nations in Modern European History,"The history of Europe has generally been told through the stories of its constituent nations. Yet most Europeans over the past three centuries lived in empires. This course will place empire at the center of the history of modern Europe, focusing both on land empires within Europe and the overseas empire, and view the nation as a challenger whose ultimate victory was – and is – far from certain. Beginning with the emergence of modern national ideas in the late 18th century, we will trace the complex relationship between European nation-states and empires until the present day.

History,HIST,41.02,"Race, Gender, & Revolution in the Atlantic World","This course examines how the events and intellectual production of the Haitian Revolution and decolonization struggles in the Spanish Empire shook the Atlantic World and forced a reconsideration of political categories such as liberty, tyranny, citizenship, rights, and the relationship of race and gender to all of these concepts.

Of special interest will be the relationship between medieval thinkers and the society in which they lived, the role of ritual, ceremony, and magic, and the persistence of heresy.

History,HIST,82.01,The Politics of Natural Disaster in Latin America,"In September 2017 two massive hurricanes, Irma and María, swept the Caribbean. As a result, Barbuda was left uninhabitable, Puerto Rico’s unofficial death toll was estimated in the thousands, and Dominica resembled a war zone. Hundreds of thousands were left without electricity and potable water in a region that was already suffering from stagnating economies and humanitarian crises. These natural events and their unnatural consequences laid bare the region’s legacy of colonialism, underdevelopment, and failing infrastructures. Things will never go back to the way they were before. Yet, these events are hardly unique in the Caribbean and Latin American experience.
\fLatin America, and the Caribbean region within it, have not only been shaped by human development but also by natural events. Hurricanes and earthquakes—the two natural events this course focuses on—have transformed the region’s landscape.

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath.

History,HIST,90.07,The Great Migrations in American History,"In the decades between the 1910s and the 1970s, millions of southerners left the rural South for the booming cities of the North and West, in what was inarguably one of the most significant demographic events of the 20th century. From the Chicago blues to the Bakersfield Sound; The Grapes of Wrath to Black Boy; the Black Panthers to the Southern Baptist Convention—the influence of the southern migrations can be seen everywhere in American society during these years. Rather than treating the experiences of black and white migrants separately, this course takes a comparative approach to these simultaneous and parallel migrations, focusing on the political and economic factors that drove out-migration from the South; the impact that southern migration had on race relations and labor markets in northern and western cities; the diasporic communities formed by southern migrants in their new homes; and the impact of the migrations on American culture and politics over the course of the 20th century.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-90-07

The conversion of ‘barbarian’ peoples in northwest Europe between the years 400 and 1000 meant Christianity had to adapt to a different environment than the Roman and Mediterranean one in which the religion developed. The northern world was without the Roman Empire, without cities, with different languages, cultures and notions of relations between the human and divine worlds. This course explores the impact the conversion of Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, and Nordic communities had on Christianity, as well as why communities of the northern world voluntarily chose to adopt this new religion. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-91-02
History,HIST,92.01,Caribbean History: 1898 to the Present,"This course surveys the major issues that have shaped Caribbean society from the late 19th-century to the present, including: imperialism, urbanization, migration and globalization, struggles for national independence, the transition from plantation to tourism-based economies, and the global spread of Caribbean popular culture. Our readings and discussions will focus on the historical trajectories of Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, and the Dominican Republic using historical scholarship, music, literature, film, and personal narratives.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-92-01
History,HIST,92.02,Nationalism and Revolution in the Caribbean,"The islands of the Caribbean have seen two revolutionary upheavals of the modern era—the Haitian Revolution and the Cuban Revolution and have produced a diverse cadre of anti-colonial activists and intellectuals. Beginning with the uprising of enslaved laborers in Saint Domingue in 1791, the course explores the history of nationalist movements in the Spanish-, English-, and French-speaking Caribbean. We will analyze and compare the ideological underpinnings of nationalist movements, discuss ways in which nationalist leaders have attempted to mobilize popular support, and consider why violent revolutionary struggles erupted in some Caribbean territories but not in others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-92-02

This course will examine the history of African slavery in the region from the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade to the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888. For each class session, students will review primary source documents such as autobiographies, slave codes, plantation journals, visual images, and anti-slavery tracts as well as historical scholarship.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-92-03
History,HIST,92.04,Partition in South Asia,"In the years leading to 1947, nationalist activism against the British and tensions between Hindus and Muslims escalated in the Indian subcontinent. This culminated in Partition and the emergence of the nations of India and Pakistan. Independence was marred, however, by the bloodshed accompanying the mass movements of Muslims into Pakistan and Hindus into India. What were the factors leading to this juxtaposition of triumphal Independence with shameful Partition? What were the implications of Partition for ordinary people? How have memories of Partition continued to affect powerful politics and culture in the subcontinent? This seminar investigates such questions using a wide variety of materials including films, memoirs, fiction and scholarly works. This course follows recent scholarship in focusing on the long-term implications of Partition for the subcontinent. Hence, while we certainly will investigate the events leading up to Partition, our emphasis will be on understanding the effect of Partition on the lives of ordinary people during and after.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-92-04
History,HIST,92.05,The City in Modern South Asia,"South Asian cities are currently undergoing massive demographic and spatial transformations. These cannot be understood without a consideration of both the specific history of South Asia and a broader account of urban change. This course examines these changes in historical perspective and situates urban South Asia within a global context. How did colonial rule transform cities such as Delhi, Lahore, and Bombay? How were the differing ideologies of India and Pakistan mapped onto new capitals such as Chandigarh and Islamabad? How are ethnic pasts and techno futures reconciled in booming cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai? How are slums produced and what are the experiences of people living in them? What are the connections between the urban environment and political mobilization? We consider a range of sources, including scholarly literature, films, and short stories.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-92-05

(Octavian/Augustus' success at the battle of Actium) through the accession and rule of Septimius Severus. During this period, the Roman empire (signifying the territorial extent conquered by Roman armies and administered by Roman officials) became a political community extending throughout the Mediterranean and northwards into Europe as far as Scotland. This course considers the logic of the Roman system: the mechanisms promoting the political identity of diverse peoples as Roman, and the endurance of local traditions within the Roman world; the reasoning whereby the overarching leadership of a single individual was conceived as necessary and good, and the evolving relationship between the princeps and the Roman senatorial aristocracy with a tradition of competitive participation and self identity in politics at Rome; the definition of the Roman frontiers and the role of the army in the assimilation of non-Roman peoples.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-94-06

The legal, political and cultural framework of the European city shaped the trajectory of the Jews in a profound and lasting way, and cities and metropolises continue to shape Jewish civilization in many ways. From the Venetian ghetto to the Lower East Side, from the pletzl in Paris to the vast neighborhoods in the first Jewish metropolises in Eastern Europe, the different settings shaped Jewish civilization.

To this end, we will look at rights movements in Middle East, Latin America, and Asian contexts, and attend to the often-complicated history of such movements in the context of imperialism and war. In this course, we will ask: What are human rights, and what is their history? What is the relationship between human rights and earlier languages of rights? What counts as a human right? Can there be a universal standard for human rights despite social difference? What political and ethical possibilities have been opened for marginalized communities by the language of human rights, and what possibilities have been foreclosed by the often-singular focus on human rights as a panacea against all social ills? And finally: do our demands for human rights work to make the world a more just place, and are these demands enough?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/History/HIST-History/HIST-96-33

Two millennia later, artists of the ‘modernist’ movement in architecture and the revolutionary art form of motion pictures had similar visions: in shaping our spaces and images we shape ourselves; humanity is designed. What ideas of art and architecture, of humanity and human nature are at stake? We’ll study this theme as it arises in key episodes in the history of cinema and architecture, and in today’s transmedia environment.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-3-01
Humanities,HUM,3.02,Two Empires under the Sun: Han China and the Roman Empire,"Two modern superpowers, China and the United States, trace their origins back to ancient China and Rome. The empires of Han China and the Roman Republic/early Principate (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) inhabited opposite edges of the Eurasian land mass and shared no common roots. Yet they make for compelling case studies; key documents from written texts to artifacts such as coins, tombs, murals and inscriptions will help us explore these civilizations' ideas about the universe, empire, family, and the human body. Students will compare the societies, politics, and cultural frameworks of Han China and Rome to see the value of deep historical perspective for understanding the modern world and cultural difference.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-3-02
Humanities,HUM,3.03,Fascinating Fascisms of Germany and Japan,"In her 1974 essay entitled “Fascinating Fascism,” Susan Sontag argues that the fascism that plunged the world into war in the 1930s and 1940s was in essence an aesthetic mode distinguished by its horrifying blend of sublime beauty with apocalyptic violence.  This class will investigate the similarities and differences of two particular brands of fascism (the German and the Japanese) in hopes of identifying and understanding the cultural and ideological dynamic that makes this worldview possible.  Wartime Germany and Japan represent two distinct cultural, linguistic and historical constellations and yet in the period in question they shared a surprising number of commonalities: resuscitations of ancient mythologies, discourses of ethnic purity and racial superiority, and conflations of medieval narratives and modernist sensibilities.  The instructors hope that the comparison of the disparate contexts that gave rise to such similar wartime cultures will reveal something essential to the fascist condition.  Course materials will include fiction, autobiographical writing, film, cultural criticism, anthropological studies, and musical compositions.  The class will include Canvas on-line discussions, collaborative learning activities, and a final research paper.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-3-03
Humanities,HUM,3.04,Through Others’ Eyes:  Muslims and Christians after Charlemagne,"This course will examine the dynamic history of the Muslim-Christian encounter. It will focus on pre-modern representations of both the Muslim ‘other’ in Europe and Europeans in the Muslim Mediterranean world. Three texts from different periods – the anonymous Song of Roland (1129-65); Amin Maalouf, The Crusades Through Arab Eyes (1983); and Ludovico Ariosto, Mad Orlando (1532) – in dialogue with historical documents, visual materials and performative elements, will allow cross-disciplinary exploration over a wide temporal arc of the ways Muslims and Christians have creatively processed their complex interdependence. The Mediterranean basin has been a space less of boundaries than of mutual influence, as the many aspects of the sustained Muslim-Christian encounter attest.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-3-04
Humanities,HUM,3.05,The Invention of News,"News does not “happen,” it gets made—by human agents, cultural practices, material media, and networks of communication. This course charts the history of the making of news in Europe (with side glances at South America for contrastive focus), spanning from the exchange of rumors in the medieval period to the establishment of national daily papers in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. At once a media history and a survey of key medieval and early modern textual genres, it explores the rich international media environment in which spoken, sung, handwritten, and printed news interacted and shaped the core features of the newspaper as we know it today. Analyzing genres such as chronicles, sermons, Khipu messages, letters, broadsides, travel writings, and ballads, the course investigates the relationship of news to historiography, theology, administrative practices, political activism, and entertainment. Topics will include news as a prerogative of elites vs. news as a medium of the masses; questions of veracity, manipulation, and trust; the production of news and colonialism; the relationship of news to time; and the emergence and managing of public opinion.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-3-05
Humanities,HUM,4.01,From Modernism to Postmodernism,"Fredric Jameson once described postmodernity as “the effort to take the temperature of the age without instruments and in a situation in which we are not even sure there is so coherent a thing as an ‘age,’ or ‘zeitgeist’ any longer.” Taking the temperature of the age through a comparative reading of modern and postmodern texts, we will try to seize the change from one era and movement to the other by way of elucidating a number of modern and postmodern concepts such as “representation” or “literary self-reflexivity,” “the world as text,” “the death of the author” or “the end of meta-narratives.” Movies, art works, essays and some theoretical texts will enhance the literary readings, which include texts by modern and postmodern writers such as Abish, Fowles, James, Stein, and Woolf. The feature that characterizes and associates the two movements best is their awareness for how form impacts content, or, as Gertrude Stein said, “how writing is written.” The world comes into being and takes shape in the words we use, the texts we write, the images we produce, the movies we shoot, or the maps we draw to name only some of the signifying systems that give the universe a form.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-4-01
Humanities,HUM,4.02,The Sixties,"With the possible exception of the Civil War, no period of American history was more transformative than the era from 1963 to 1974, commonly referred to as ""The Sixties."" As the nation mourned its slain president, John F. Kennedy, American society was convulsed with social revolutions ranging from the civil rights movement and the assertion of women's equality and gay rights to the emergence of a counterculture and its assault on traditional institutions. The era witnessed both Freedom Summer and the murders of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr., the assassinations of two Kennedy brothers, the shootings at Kent State and the emergence of Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy and his Silent Majority.
This course will be organized chronologically, with approximately one week devoted to each of the years of ""The Sixties."" Each week, lectures will provide the historical context, supplemented by a sampling of the music, art, and literature characteristic of the era.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Humanities/HUM-Humanities/HUM-4-02

Jewish Studies,JWST,21,New York and the Metropolitan Imagination in Twentieth-Century American Jewish Literature,"This course will offer an introduction to American Jewish culture by focusing on the perception of New York City among successive generations of Jewish writers, performers, and cultural activists. Although our focus will be primarily on literary sources, in English and translated from Yiddish, we will also consider memoirs, political documents, journalism, music, and film. The topics we will consider include:How are the ambivalences of immigration expressed among Jewish immigrants writing, alternately, in English or in Yiddish?
How does the city provide new modes of expression for Yiddish writers?How does music offer a venue for Jewish performers to enter an American “mainstream” while preserving an audible sense of Jewish difference?How do Yiddish writers address the Holocaust, and what challenges emerge when translating Yiddish into English after the Holocaust?How do post-War Jewish intellectuals, the children of immigrants, critique their society and influence the development, and denouement, of American liberalism?How does the “sexual revolution” challenge notions of a distinct Jewish ethnicity and ethos, and what strategies do Jewish authors develop to critique changing mores and morals from a specifically Jewish perspective?How does an avant-garde Jewish theatre contribute to a contemporary understanding of American culture as multi-cultural, hybrid, and hyphenated?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-21
Jewish Studies,JWST,24.06,Love in Translation: Poetics of Desire across Cultures,"Literary traditions of the Near East possess an extensive corpus of writings that enact and speak of the importance of erotic feelings, accessible to most of us only in translation. But if articulations of love “translate” unspeakable thoughts and desires in the first place, what happens to these articulations when they are re-translated and move across cultures? What’s gained and lost in the process? These translations can be seen as crucibles for cultural encounter and models for self-other relations and gender identity. How have translations challenged (or perpetuated) hegemonic ideas about sexual morality, stylistic propriety, the religious and the profane? How have they been generative in the target literatures and why? We will examine key intersections of love and translation, compare and contrast old and new translations, and become acquainted with key problems in translation theory.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-24-06

Their lives will be studied through novels, essays, autobiographies, and personal letters, but also through the arts – film, music, poetry, paintings, and sculpture. Taught in Berlin as part of the JWST/GERM FSP, this course will make extensive use of the city, its memorials, physical locations of historical events, and its remarkable current population of Jewish intellectuals who will give guest talks to the class, sometimes in conjunction with the History course taught during the FSP.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-35
Jewish Studies,JWST,36.03,Jewish-Christian Relations along the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean,"While scholars have examined various aspects of Jewish-Christian relations, and the relations of both Christians and Jews with Muslims during the Middle Ages, the tendency has been to focus on Western Europe, or only on the Middle East and Byzantium. Yet both Jews and Christians of various kinds moved along the trade routes over land and sea throughout Asia and parts of Africa. There they traded, settled, studied, interacted with one another and other religious groups, and they invented new understandings of what it meant to be Jewish or Christian, and how these two identities might intertwine. In Asia and Africa Jews and Christians often found themselves on equal footing with one another, as minorities under Islamic, Mongol or Confucian, or Hindu rule. At other times, Jews had polities and territories of their own, for example in Khazaria or Ethiopia, with which neighboring Christian and Muslim rulers had to deal. In other instances, Jews were under Christian rule, but under Christians, for example, medieval Georgians, with a rather different history and polemical tradition than in Byzantium or the West. In this course, we will focus on Jewish-Christian relations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, West, Central, South, and East Asia, and in Africa, especially Ethiopia. Students will learn of Jewish and Christian travel and settlement in these lands, and the different expressions of Judaism and Christianity there, and forms of interaction between communities. We will also examine the imaginings, polemic, and stories that these communities developed about one another and which developed between these communities, and how these also travelled and changed with new cultural milieus, for example, how Byzantine anti-Jewish stories were transformed when they were retold in Armenia or Ethiopia. Other religious communities will be taken into account as context for these interactions, but will not be the main focus of the class.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-36-03
Jewish Studies,JWST,37.02,"Nazis, Neonazis, Antifa and the Others: Exploring Responses to the Nazi Past","Why do the Nazis remain the world’s epitome of evil? What did they actually do? And how specifically are they remembered, depicted, emulated, despised or ignored since the catastrophes of the mid-twentieth Century? In this course we will examine the main events connected with the Second World War, the genocide of European Jewry and Roma-Sinti, forced resettlements of various populations, and the Allied attacks on the German civilian population.  We will analyze the different stages of coming to grips with that past on the part of German and some other postwar societies, by examining together a number of controversies like those surrounding the Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Eichmann and Barbie trials, the campaign to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, Neonazism, the Wehrmacht photo exhibition, and the current campaign to remember German civilian casualties and losses.  Approaching our topic with interdisciplinary and comparative methodology, that is, by utilizing history, journalism, video testimony, music, literature, and art, including film, photography and architecture, students will develop their own perspectives on the formation of postwar German identity and why Nazis remain the epitome of evil. An individual midterm project will allow students to practice the skill of summarizing different sides of a debate, and a final group project will invite students to solidify what they have learned in the course about the formation of national identity by creatively staging a contemporary debate about the Nazi past.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-37-02

Jewish Studies,JWST,44,The Making of the Modern Middle East,"This panoramic course surveys major developments in Middle East history, politics, and society. Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the ""Arab Spring” and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-44
Jewish Studies,JWST,45,Soundscapes of the Middle East,"In recent years, scholars have started to question the conspicuous “silence” pervading many academic works that privilege one sense – sight – to the detriment of all others. This seminar builds upon these long overdue efforts by critically engaging the writings of historians, anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, and media experts with the aim of uncovering how the study of sound may radically enrich our understanding of the modern Middle East. Beginning with an overview of sound studies, we will consider where multi-sensory scholarship on North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf fits into this burgeoning field of inquiry. After situating the Middle East within a body of literature that is at once innovative and highly interdisciplinary, we will then shift to exploring several key themes, including religion, popular culture, mass media, gender, space, and the environment, in relation to the region’s soundscapes. We will listen to audiocassette sermons in Egypt, jazz in Istanbul, and the din of warfare in Iraq, among many other acoustic items, to gain a greater appreciation for the centrality of sound in people’s everyday lives and its significance in the domain of Middle Eastern studies.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-45

Jewish Studies,JWST,61,Modern Judaism,"This course will trace the ways Jews in modernity made sense, challenged, adopted, and adapted modern thought, culture, and politics in their recalibration of Judaism. The role Jews played in modernity in well-known. But how did Jews re-think Judaism in ways that enabled it and them both to survive the challenges of modernity and also retain a sense of difference enough to enable Jews to assimilate yet not disappear. In this course we will look at some of the major trends and thinkers from the 17th through the 21st centuries as they struggled to reinterpret Judaism for the modern age.

Jewish Studies,JWST,74.01,The Jewish Jesus,"It is certain that Jesus of Nazareth lived in the first century C.E. and that his followers interpreted his life and death as harbingers of a new age. However, recent scholarship has made clear that Jesus was fully embedded in the Judaism of his time: the Jewish diversity of the period and Jewish resistance to the Roman Empire. This course examines the life of Jesus the Jew prior to the early Church's interpretation of Jesus as Christ; modern Jewish and Islamic views of Jesus, as well as his portrayal in contemporary film and art, will also be explored.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Jewish-Studies/JWST-Jewish-Studies/JWST-74-01

After a brief survey of the physical and cultural geography of the region, the course examines the history of selected countries to highlight the way European conquest and colonialism have molded Latin American institutions and attitudes. The course then turns to particular case studies of contemporary life and society to analyze the ongoing problems of ethnicity, inequality, and political repression engendered by the region's colonial past. Finally, the course draws on these historical and anthropological understandings to assess recent economic, social, and political developments in Latin America. By juxtaposing historical realities with their living consequences, the course presents a multi-disciplinary perspective on the nature, dynamics-and future prospects-of the many peoples who inhabit this vast and diverse continent.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Latin-American-Latino-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-1

Since colonial times Latin American and Caribbean cultures have developed against a background of cultural repression, racial conflict, political domination, colonial exploitation, and gender inequality. And yet, in the midst of all this turmoil, Latin America and the Caribbean have produced an extraordinary variety and wealth of artistic creations, ranging from literature to the visual arts, from music to film.

Bringing mixed-method approaches to the study of the people from Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama will allow us to explore the centrality of the isthmian region to the development of hemispheric politics and these nations’ centrality to the formation of Latin American culture.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Latin-American-Latino-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-8
"Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies",LACS,24,Mexican Cinema,"This course serves as an introduction to Mexican cinema and the global system of filmmaking in which it developed. We will examine the history of Mexican film, filmmaking practices, aesthetics and business concerns, as well as audiences inside and outside of Mexico. One central point of inquiry will be the extent to which Mexican cinema was truly ""national."" We will question the concept of “national cinema” all the while analyzing the extent to which issues in Mexican politics, society, and culture were reflected on and influenced by the screen. The transnationality of Mexican film will be central to our investigation as we examine the influence of the United States and Hollywood during Mexican cinema’s development. Students will learn about the various styles and genres of Mexican film and the theories with which film scholars have interpreted them. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Sergei Eisenstein, Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez, Luis Buñuel, Alfonso Arau, Maria Novaro, Natalia Almada, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, and Alejandro Gonzales-Iñárritu.

We will focus on canonical works—including West Side Story, Zoot Suit, and Hamilton—in order to deepen our knowledge of their form, production history, historical reception, and contemporary place in American culture. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing our reading assignments from the fields of Ethnic Studies, American Studies, Performance Studies, and Film and Media Studies, in order to analyze these productions as they traveled from stage to screen (and sometimes, back to the stage) and the representational and cultural politics involved in that shift. Finally, we will explore not only the musicals themselves, but also the historiography that has informed our understanding of them. Writing assignments will ask the students to reflect on the evolution of scholarly arguments regarding these canonical works.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Latin-American-Latino-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-24-30
"Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies",LACS,24.50,Latinx-ploitation,"This course serves as an introduction to the history of Latinx cinema, Latinx film spectatorship, and exploitation cinema in the United States. Latinx audiences have long been an interest and target of the Hollywood studios. Since the beginning of sound in film, the studios grappled with reaching this linguistically and culturally-diverse demographic. Since the late 20th century, the studios have widely acknowledged the box office power of that group. Time and again, however, the Hollywood industry has failed to accurately identify and engage Latinx peoples on both sides of the US-Mexico border. Applying theories of racialized spectatorship and performance and film genre and authorship, we will interrogate this historically troubled relationship and grapple with its consequences for Latinx representation and inclusion in American cinema.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Latin-American-Latino-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-24-50

Beginning with a quick overview of key forerunners, this course will focus on the major directors, genres and aesthetic trends that characterize the new Latin American cinema.

In this course we will place artists like Jose Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance. We will cover art produced in Mexico from the turn of the 20th century through the “boom” years of the 1990s, with a focus on issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality throughout. To concretize our understanding of modern art in Mexico, we will research and create an exhibition of select works from the Hood Museum of Art’s collection of Mexican art.

Since 2013, the climate in Brazilian society has become more and more tense due to a series of street protests and polarized public debates on race, class, political representation, democracy, religion, gender, sexuality, environmental protection and economic justice. The present scenario in Brazil will be discussed in relation to historical and cultural contexts.

This course explores that tradition of cultural activism, considering attempts to narrate revolutionary formation, imagine solidarity, and write decolonial theory. We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas—ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature—in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners. We will pay special attention to the work of feminist and queer solidarity artists, writers, and performers. Finally, we will examine contemporary activist cultural projects, such as PanAmerican public art road trips and hashtag-activism.

Mystical worlds. Brazilian authors have been writing about the fantastic and unreal for centuries, a tradition that extends far beyond what has been characterized as “magical realism.” This course will explore this rich literature, both on its own and in a comparative perspective. In particular, we will examine the political, psychological, ecological, and historical questions that these works raise. How, for example, does fantastic literature shed light on psychoanalytic concepts such as the uncanny? How did Brazilian writers in the late 1960s use science fiction, horror, and fantasy to address the repression of the military dictatorship? What kinds of broad theoretical issues arise when looking at this genre? We will read works from “canonical” authors such as Machado de Assis, Lygia Fagundes Telles, Mário de Andrade, and Guimarães Rosa as well as those by lesser-known and up-and-coming writers, comic artists, and filmmakers.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Latin-American-Latino-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-30-13

"Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies",LACS,44.40,"On Survivors, Memories, and Tombs: State Violence in South America through Literature and Cinema","In the 1960s and 1970s, South America experienced a new cycle of state violence perpetrated by military dictatorships. The authoritarian regimes installed in Brazil (1964-85), Uruguay (1973-85), Chile (1973-90) and Argentina (1976-83) caused deep ruptures in collective and individual lives and still resonate in the South American political, social and cultural landscapes. After the democratic systems were reestablished in the region, new facts about the abuse of power by the militaries were disclosed, and a heated debate took place in the public sphere about how to deal with the past. Feature films, documentaries, and fiction and non-fiction literature played an essential role in that debate by providing different strategies of healing scars, honoring victims and survivors, and preserving the memory of both the terror and the grassroots resistance. The experiences and memories of the so-called ""dirty war"" in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay generated not only several fictional renderings of state terrorism during the ""years of lead,"" but also a whole series of testimonios by those directly affected by it, such as the daughters, sons and spouses of desaparecidos who were assassinated by the machinery of state repression.
This class focuses on the legacies of dictatorships in South America and the politics and aesthetics of representation of state violence and political resistance. Students will be introduced to central concepts of memory and trauma studies and will conduct comparative literary and cinematic analyses of works by Latin American writers and film directors.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Latin-American-Latino-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-44-40

"Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies",LATS,51,"Beyond Sex, Drugs, and Rock ‘n Roll: Radical Latinxs in the 60’s","The 1960s and 70s were a time of tremendous political and creative turmoil in the US in general and for Latinos in particular. Joining in the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-Vietnam mobilization, Latinos also fought for their rights founding important political organizations such as the Raza Unida Party; MeCHA, the United Farm Workers, the Brown Berets, the Nuyorican Young Lords Party, among many others. Beyond traditional stereotypes of the 60s as the period of drugs, sex and rock ‘n roll, protesters and political activists were inordinately adept at creating and mobilizing artistic symbols, music, and literature to promote their agenda. We will study the creation of Aztlán as an imaginary Chicano homeland in the Southwest; works of individual Latino artists and writers; important journals (Con Safos, Chismearte, Arte del Varrio); organizations such as the Royal Chicano Air Force, Asco, Galería de la Raza, the Teatro Campesino, the Nuyorican Poets’ Café; national monuments such as Chicano Park; and exhibitions such as Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA; held at UCLA).

Linguistics,LING,5.01,Words,"In this course we will explore all aspects of this most familiar unit of language. Among the questions we will address are: How exactly can we – or dictionary-makers – describe the precise meaning of a word? Is this even possible? How can two politicians honestly differ about the meaning of the word ""lie""? How can a word’s meaning change over time? How and why are words borrowed from one language into another? How do our brains think of the words we want so fast? Why do we sometimes mishear song lyrics? What kinds of building blocks make up a word, and what ways are there of inventing new words?

Linguistics,LING,11.13,The Language-Music Connection,"Language and music are universal components of human experience, so integral that they are often considered part of what defines us as humans. While we treat them as distinct phenomena, the overlap between the two is immense, structurally, neurologically, and culturally. Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated.

Mathematics - Undergraduate,MATH,5.04,Fundamental Applied Mathematics for the Sciences,"Mathematics is the language of science. However, mathematics preparation for most science students typically involves only the study of calculus at the university level. While many scientific problems involve calculus, two other areas of mathematics are equally (if not more) important: linear algebra and probability. For example, linear algebra is fundamental to stoichiometry and the conservation of matter in chemistry, hydrology and atmospheric dynamics in earth sciences, and cell growth and population dynamics in biology. Moreover, most features of the natural world are probabilistic and frequently best described by probability models, such as the firing of neurons in the brain or the timing of earthquakes. Both are also central to all problems in statistics. This course will explore the application of linear algebra and probability to problems across the sciences. We will cover the basics of solving linear algebra and probability problems as well as formulating simple models to describe and analyze natural phenomena from across the sciences.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Mathematics/MATH-Mathematics-Undergraduate/MATH-5-04

In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath.

Middle Eastern Studies,MES,10.10,Soundscapes of the Middle East,"In recent years, scholars have started to question the conspicuous “silence” pervading many academic works that privilege one sense – sight – to the detriment of all others. This seminar builds upon these long overdue efforts by critically engaging the writings of historians, anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, and media experts with the aim of uncovering how the study of sound may radically enrich our understanding of the modern Middle East. Beginning with an overview of sound studies, we will consider where multi-sensory scholarship on North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf fits into this burgeoning field of inquiry. After situating the Middle East within a body of literature that is at once innovative and highly interdisciplinary, we will then shift to exploring several key themes, including religion, popular culture, mass media, gender, space, and the environment, in relation to the region’s soundscapes. We will listen to audiocassette sermons in Egypt, jazz in Istanbul, and the din of warfare in Iraq, among many other acoustic items, to gain a greater appreciation for the centrality of sound in people’s everyday lives and its significance in the domain of Middle Eastern studies.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-10-10

From Baghdad, the present-day capital of Iraq, Abbasid caliphs ruled a vast Muslim empire from the eighth to the thirteenth centuries. The political history of modern Iraq, however, has been characterized by authoritarian rule, communal strife, wars and occupation. In this course, we will examine the politics of Iraq under the British mandate, as an independent state under the monarchy, and as a republic after the coup of 1958. We will also examine the rule of the Baath and of Saddam Hussein as well as the American invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. Drawing on a mixture of texts and media, the course explores the prevalent tropes of Iraqi culture, the ideologies underpinning these tropes and in doing so provides a cultural context for understanding the forces that shaped the modern history of that country.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-12-02
Middle Eastern Studies,MES,12.03,"Egyptian Culture, Society, and Politics","This seminar will examine the cultural, social, and political life of modern Egypt. One way of examining this complex society is through revisiting Egypt&rsquo;s struggle with modernity. From Mohamad Ali&rsquo;s modernization program in the 19th century to the recent chanting for freedom in Tahrir Square, Egypt&rsquo;s different social forces, state, and international partners have been shaping its modernity in different&mdash;sometimes contradictory&mdash;ways. This struggle transformed the political, economic, social and cultural landscape of the country, and continues to be the focal point of its unfolding drama. The spread of modern ideologies (nationalism, liberalism, socialism), the construction of Islamism, the reordering of social hierarchies and family structure, the transformation of norms and values, among other issues, are better understood when read as part of this long, twisted, and tormented march of modernity.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-12-03
Middle Eastern Studies,MES,12.04,America and the Middle East,"The United States has played a major role in shaping the political, economic and cultural development of the Middle East. Oil, global security, Israel’s survival, and promotion of democracy, all have drawn the US into the complex politics of the Middle East since the 1920s. This course introduces students to various aspects of this role and the reactions it triggered. It covers the role played by American missionaries and travelers/immigrants around the turn of the 20th century. It analyzes the transformative impact of the discovery of Oil, the establishment of the state of Israel, the Cold War, Turkey’s integration into NATO and the US attempts to establish a security regime for the Middle East. It also examines how Americans viewed the Middle East and their role in its life. In addition, the course then takes the students in a tour d’horizon of US role in Middle East politics: its involvement in the Arab-Israeli Peace Process, its responses to Radical Islamism and 9/11, the invasion of Iraq and its consequences, the uneasy relationship with a changing Turkey, and its policy of “democracy promotion”. It discusses the doctrines defining US role in the region since Truman until Obama’s “disengagement”. Combining academic books with novels and movies, this course should give students a rounded view of the role and lasting impact of the United States in one of the world’s most turbulent regions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-12-04

Middle Eastern Studies,MES,12.06,Dictatorship and Dissent: the Middle East in a Global Context,"Dictatorship is the defining characteristic of some governments, especially in the Arab world. Dictatorship is usually described as a strongman imposing his will on the nation through sheer force. French political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie (1530–1563) in his seminal essay Discours de la servitude volontaire (Discourse on Voluntary Servitude) presented the existence of a dictatorship as a relationship between two parties. Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome. The dictionary defines a syndrome as “a group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.” In this course, students will examine the condition, signs, symptoms, and cures for the malady of dictatorship.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-12-06
Middle Eastern Studies,MES,12.07,The Sociology of International Development,"This course will introduce students to the major sociological perspectives on economic and political development, with emphasis on developing countries. Among the views to be considered are modernization, which assumes that later developing countries will follow paths once traveled by today's advanced countries; and dependency and world system theories, which view the integration of less developed countries into the world market as problematic and, under certain conditions, even disadvantageous. We will test these theories by applying them to specific cases. A major part of the course will focus on the economic 'miracle' of East Asian countries, as well as cases that have not been so successful. Other important topics to be studied include the influence of states, markets, and multinational corporations in economic development; the relationship between different modes of development and income distribution; and political development and the prospects for democratization.

The latter part of the course relies on documentary films that contain actual footages of Iran’s nationalist movement in the 1950s and the revolutionary struggles in 1979.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-12-08

Rebellion could be a political act (an uprising against a colonial power or an authoritarian regime), a psychological act (rebellion against the father), and an artistic act (rebellion against a system of values and traditions). These realms are interconnected and it’s precisely their intersection that the students will analyze by engaging works by modern Arab authors. Exploring this theme in a comparative context, the students will explore the politics of language, the relation to personal and national identity, and the implications of writing in the language of the other (French, Hebrew, English, etc.). Each week focuses on one Arab author, situating his/her work in the appropriate historical and social context, and doing close readings of his/her work.

It takes as its focus a critical examination of representations of identity and change in modern Arabic discourses. Blending lectures and class discussions, the course will also explore the ways in which literary forms and narrative strategies tend to reinforce or contest normative power structures. Examination of motifs, literary styles, and assumptions pertaining to gender, sexuality, and class and socio-religious affiliation will also be undertaken.

But if articulations of love “translate” unspeakable thoughts and desires in the first place, what happens to these articulations when they are re-translated and move across cultures? What’s gained and lost in the process? These translations can be seen as crucibles for cultural encounter and models for self-other relations and gender identity. How have translations challenged (or perpetuated) hegemonic ideas about sexual morality, stylistic propriety, the religious and the profane? How have they been generative in the target literatures and why? We will examine key intersections of love and translation, compare and contrast old and new translations, and become acquainted with key problems in translation theory.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-16-37

This dislocation manifests itself not only with respect to space, but also in relationship to history, language, political power, and above all in the psychological relationship that diasporic subjects maintain with themselves. This course will focus on two primary examples of diaspora in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Jews and Africans, to examine the multiplicity of relationships among language, literary structure, as well as gender and sexuality that inform the construction of diasporic literatures. Although this course cannot be comprehensive in its survey of either Jewish or African literatures, it will offer suggestive juxtapositions of the two to emphasize commonalities between their historical and political experience. It will also explore how the once exceptional condition of diaspora increasingly has become representative for more and more people in the world today.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-16-39

However, recent scholarship has made clear that Jesus was fully embedded in the Judaism of his time: the Jewish diversity of the period and Jewish resistance to the Roman Empire.

Middle Eastern Studies,MES,17.15,The Middle East in the United States: Jews and Arabs in American Society,"The complex identities of Jews and Arabs alike are affected by religion, culture, language, history, and politics, all in their own terms and with the fault lines running both between and within the two communities. Despite their internal and mutual conflicts, the two groups share similar experiences of hostility when trying to integrate into American society with fierce antisemitism and Islamophobia against the backdrop of increasing right-wing ethno-nationalism. Concomitantly, both groups share deep ambivalences about assimilating to American culture vs. retaining discrete cultural identities. If Jews and Arabs play decisive roles in US politics, both as effective actors and as imagined targets of opposition, the United States in turn acted not only as mediator in the international relationship between the two groups; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, post-9/11 politics, anti-terrorist actions, or the Trump administration’s travel ban on five Muslim-dominated countries have also influenced the relationship between Jewish and Arab communities within the United States. Instead of equating the experiences of Jews and Arabs viz-a-viz America, this course examines the multifaceted encounters in what has to be considered a complex Jewish-Arab-American triangular. The ways in which Jews and Arabs interact in the US, will be as central to the course as examples of hybrid cultural experiences of Arab Jews and artefacts such as the numerous American synagogues built in the style of Moorish architecture. We will examine cultural representations of Jews and Arabs in American literature, movies, documentaries, memoirs, art, popular culture and political analyses with attention to aspects of class, race and gender. Finally, the course will focus on the political expressions of Jewish- and Arab-Americans and their relations to the Middle East, and here in particular to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-17-15

How do they self-identify, what modes of writing do they establish to represent their experience and how are they represented by others? This course will examine the stories of Jews of Arab descent with particular emphasis on their anomalous place in the cultural production of the Middle East that spanned over a century and a half. We will consider the transformation of Arab Jewish experience in various historical configurations and analyze the various media and literary genres with which this group expresses itself. Discussion will also draw on interdisciplinary scholarship to address questions of memory and self-narration, hybridity and cosmopolitanism, literature and identity politics. Alternative views will be afforded of both Arab and Jewish historiographies, political movements and collective myths. We will read works by Jacqueline Kahanoff, Samir Naqqash, Sami Michael, Shimon Balas, Ronny Somek, and Ronit Matalon and scholarship by Lital Levy, Hannan Hever, Orit Bashkin, and Yehuda Shenav.

We will study Jewish understandings of Islam: the articulated differences between Jewish and Muslim beliefs, particularly in relation to prophecy, revelation, scripture, and messianism; the ways that Islam served as a template for presenting Judaism to modern Christian Europe; the alliance forged between Jewish scholars and their imagined Islam as a polemical tool against Christianity; the rise of Oriental Studies and Religious Studies in Europe and the role played within that field by Jewish scholars; Jewish-authored travelogues to Muslim countries; and individual cases of conversions from Judaism to Islam. We will examine Arab-Jewish intellectual and literary creativity and how Orientalism has shaped other cultural phenomena, specifically early psychoanalytic writings.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-17-18

One of the mainobjectives of the course is to look at artpractices that attempt to deepen ourunderstanding of the varied cultures,ethnicities and societies that are found in thispart of the world. The geographic focus of thecourse–mostly the Muslim nations of theArabian peninsula and North Africa–is notmeant to perpetuate the assumptions aboutthis region as a monolithic geopolitical entity,nor to blindly label its production according toexisting ethnic, religious or nationalcategories. Against media stereotypes of theregion, the artists studied in this course havemade work that function as a critical platformfor rethinking traditional identity formationsand extending the space of cultural encounteracross borders (territorial, political, linguistic).In many cases these artists may not be livingand working in their country of birth but theirethnicity, religion or citizenship continues toinform both their own sense of identity and theterms of their art practice. Some of the topicsto be discussed include: artistic responses tothe Arab-Israeli conflict, representations ofeveryday life in times of war, the movementand obstruction of people, goods andinformation across borders, the rise of new artmarkets in the Middle East, the politics ofgender and sexuality in the Arab world, andthe of use archival documents to rethink themeaning of evidence, truth and testimony.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-18-01

We will explore similarities and differences in women's experiences and feminist methodologies across global Muslim contexts.

Middle Eastern Studies,MES,19.04,Gender and The Modern Middle East and North Africa,"In this course, we will study histories of the modern Middle East and North Africa and examine the ways that issues relating to gender and sexuality have affected the politics and social worlds of the region over the course of the past several centuries. This course begins with the medieval Islamicate Empires — Mughal, Safavid, and Ottoman — and then moves through the end of empire, the colonial era, the establishment of the nation state, and the emergence of modern cultural, political, and religious movements. In doing so, we will situate the histories and social worlds of the region in a global frame, asking how global political and economic transformations have affected the region. At the same time that we attend closely to these histories, we will also examine the ways in which the category of “woman” has been mobilized in popular and political discourses in the 18th-21th centuries, paying particular attention to how Muslim and Middle Eastern women have been represented in various political discourses, as well as how they have represented themselves. Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-19-04

We will make critical study of the constructions of gender, femininity, masculinity, sexuality, gender relations, marriage and divorce in classical and modern Islamic texts. In asking how Islamic notions of gender are constructed, we will examine both the roles religious texts have played in shaping Muslim life and how Muslim life in its cultural diversity affects readings of religious texts. We will read works of Muslim thought on gender relations in their historical contexts and in relation to one another. Through in-class discussions, critical reading exercises, and short essay assignments, students will strengthen their literacy on global gender issues, study religio-historical ideas on gender, analyze the role of texts in shaping gender in society, and vice versa.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-19-05

How have old themes--including the clash between tradition and modernity, East-West relations, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--become renewed for the contemporary era? We will examine exciting recent novels from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, and Palestine to answer these questions.

We will read ten representative works by writers from Egypt, Lebanon, Algeria, Sudan, Palestine, and Iraq. Written over more than half a century, these novels present different—sometimes contradictory—perspectives on the “West.” Some of these novels are focused primarily on East-West relations while others represent the West in the context of large-scale sociocultural transformations in the Middle East and broader global political dynamics. To anchor our discussion of the topic and to broaden our knowledge of the ways Arabic literature has depicted the “West,” we will also read a variety of critical texts that explore the image of the West in the Arab world.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-Middle-Eastern-Studies/MES-81-03

Native American Studies Program,NAS,8,Perspectives in Native American Studies,"The growing field of Native American Studies is inherently interdisciplinary. This course gives an overview of the relevant intellectual and cultural questions of tribal expression, identity, traditional thought, continuity, and sovereignty. Using readings from the areas of literature, philosophy, visual arts, anthropology, philosophy of history, and cultural and political discourse, we will examine how their discourses are used in the construction of tribal people as Other, and how these discourses either promote or inhibit the ongoing project of colonialism in indigenous communities and lives. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-8
Native American Studies Program,NAS,11,Ancient Native Americans,"This course provides an introduction to the ancient societies of North America. The course examines the populating of the Americas and related controversies. We then concentrate on the subsequent development of diverse pre-Columbian societies that included hunter-gatherer bands in the Great Basin, the Arctic, and the sub-Arctic; Northwest Coast chiefdoms; farmers of the Southwest, such as Chaco Canyon and the desert Hohokam; and the mound-builders of the Eastern Woodlands.

Native American Studies Program,NAS,13,Feast and Forest,"This class explores the interrelated social, cultural and political dimensions of Indigenous food systems, notions of kinship, and associated land-based practices. Work in this class will link the politics of Indigenous land and resource rights with the sociality of farming, hunting, gathering, feasting and other food traditions. We will contemplate and engage various elements of Indigenous food systems and health from subsistence food traditions to government commodity foods to urban Native American food movements. Food provides a space where many concepts from Native American Studies converge including food sovereignty, interspecies thinking, land-language linkages, health disparities, Indigenous environmental ethics and Indigenous community resurgence. In this class, we will focus on experiential forms of learning and our time will be organized as weekly field excursions where we learn directly from Indigenous communities, directly from the land, and learn by doing. Nine weeks of hands-on activities will culminate by hosting a fall feast on campus.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-13
Native American Studies Program,NAS,14,The Invasion of America: American Indian History Pre-Contact to 1800,"This course surveys Native American history from pre-contact times to 1800. It offers a chronological overview of major trends and developments, supplemented by case studies and readings that illustrate key issues and events. The overall context of the course is the conflict generated by the colonial agendas of various European nations and the early republic, but the primary focus will be the historical experiences of the diverse Indian peoples of North America in the wake of European invasion and their struggles to survive in the new world that invasion and created.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-14

Native American Studies Program,NAS,16,20th Century Native American History,"Serving as the final course in a three-quarter survey of Native American history, this class reviews Native history from the late 19th century to the present, focusing on the interplay between large institutions and structures – such as federal and state governments, or the US legal system – and the lived, local experience of tribal communities. The major themes followed throughout the course of the term include: historical narrative (and what it justifies or explains), place and space (how local and national entities define territories), and indigeneity (indigenous identity).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-16
Native American Studies Program,NAS,18,Indigenous Environmental Studies,"In this course, we examine Indigenous worldviews, environmental values and everyday life through the lens of environmental issues facing Indigenous nations and communities. Our geographic focus is on North America and the Pacific, with limited examples from other places and peoples globally. Through course materials, discussions, and assignments, students gain exposure to varied Indigenous perspectives and Indigenous knowledges expressed and enacted by scholars, Elders, community people, political leaders, and activists. Key concepts in Indigenous environmental studies will be discussed including Indigenous rights and responsibilities, Indigenous environmental stewardship, energy and development, land-language linkages, tribal sovereignty and self-determination, empowerment and resurgence.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-18

How do people become knowledgeable about a landscape and how do they use theoretical and place-based, practical knowledge about forests? In this course, we attempt to see forests from different cultural and professional lenses including those of Abenaki resource practitioners and natural resource managers. We look at the ways different types of information and different cultural perspectives influence ecological restoration, conservation and land use decisions.

Native American Studies Program,NAS,22,Native American Lives,"In the past, American Indian history and experience have usually been taught through the lens of the dominant culture, while ignoring the accounts that Indian people have presented in their own words. This course will examine some key issues in Native American history and culture reflected in the biographies and autobiographies of individual American Indians. Their life stories, some contemporary and some historical, will help us understand the forces affecting the world of Native people, and how they shaped their own lives in response. Many early (auto)biographies are ""as-told-to"" narratives. Consequently, as a point of methodology, we will take time to consider the role, motives, and the effect of the amanuensis (the recorder of an oral narrative) on the story, and as a non-Native mediator of Native experience.

Native American Studies Program,NAS,25,Indian Country Today,"This course introduces students to Indian Country by way of exploring contemporary issues of importance to American Indians. Students will begin by examining briefly the concept of ""tribal sovereignty"" and the role it has, and continues to have, in driving tribal politics. Students will then broaden their understanding of Indian Country by exploring practical issues such as: American Indian political activism, repatriation of sacred objects and remains, American Indian water rights, hunting and fishing rights, gaming in Indian Country, education, and contemporary American Indian arts. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-25
Native American Studies Program,NAS,28,Native Americans and Sports,"In this course, students will explore, through intensive research, writing, and discussion, important contemporary, historical, and cultural issues related to Native Americans and sports. From time immemorial, sports have been many different things to the Indigenous peoples of North America: sacred/religious activity, entertainment, a form of warfare, an opportunity for education/social mobility, and a vehicle for fame/celebrity. By learning about the deep connections Native Americans have to five sports—lacrosse, running, football, basketball, and “alternative” sports (skateboarding, golf, and mixed martial arts)—students will gain a more profound understanding of the Native American experience in North America. Students will gain a greater knowledge of the importance of sports for Native Americans across wide geographies and chronologies. Students will also learn how Native Americans’ relationship to sports has changed over time. Most importantly, students will engage in a significant research project on a topic of their choosing related to Native Americans and sports.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-28

It also looks at how American visitors, residents, and anthropologists have imagined, understood, and represented these Native people in a variety of ways. Both the biases and insights of their perspectives are discussed and compared with the ways that indigenous tradition-bearers, activists, and academic scholars have represented their own cultures through storytelling, visual arts, museum displays, and various forms of writing.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-30-12
Native American Studies Program,NAS,30.13,History of the Indigenous Peoples of the Southwest,"In this course, we will study the Indigenous Southwest as a historical object made possible by multiple, intersecting sociocultural, economic and political projects. Rather than conceptualizing Indigenous and colonial history as separate phenomena, we will consider them as relational elements in an unequal process of creating the Southwest, as we know it today. We will begin by identifying common historical narratives of the Indigenous Southwest before moving chronologically through the processes of Spanish conquest to present-day issues of Native American self-determination. Along the way, we will focus on specific Indigenous groups–including the Apache, Navajo, Pascua Yaqui, Hopi, and Tohono O’odham–and their experiences of colonialism’s many forms. Themes to be highlighted include the major differences between Spanish, Mexican, and American colonial practices; sociocultural, economic, and political transformations of Native communities; gender dynamics, and ethnogenesis.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-30-13

To that end, students will be required to produce interpretive digital maps and/or graphs from a variety of textual, graphic, narrative, descriptive and interpretive media, and to imaginatively map patterns, themes, critical terms and cultural motifs related to sites of representation in American Indian Literature and American Indian Studies.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-30-16
Native American Studies Program,NAS,30.19,Indigistory-Dartmouth and Beyond: Digital Storytelling in American Indian Communities and Contexts,"Over the past decade American Indian communities and collaborative partners from an array of tribal organizations and public institutions have created a body of digital stories, reflecting individual and community concerns on a breadth of matters of importance to contemporary tribes. In many cases those stories address contemporary community issues, of language preservation, the importance of oral tradition, health and wellness awareness and treatment, addressing historical trauma and attending to tribal justice.  In other cases, such digital stories have served as educational tools and as means for offering qualitative assessment of research driven programs in tribal communities. In still other cases, tribally generated digital stories have addressed issues of kinship and community belonging, by referring back to roles of individual tribal members in events of historical importance to the tribal community.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-30-19
Native American Studies Program,NAS,30.20,The World Turned Upside Down: An Indigenous History of the Andes after the Spanish Invasion,"This course will explore the tension between insiders and outsiders, colonizers and the colonized, Westerners and Natives. Students will examine not only what these tensions meant for the people of the Andes – in the countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador (and to a lesser extent Chile and Colombia) - but also in what ways similar phenomena occurred in North America and other parts of the world. Among other things, students will investigate differences between insider and outsider accounts, primary and secondary sources, history and archaeology, etc. - while acknowledging the strengths and limitations of these different sources and approaches.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-30-20
Native American Studies Program,NAS,30.21,Native American Art and Material Culture,"This course examines North American Indigenous art and material culture through interdisciplinary perspectives. Throughout the course students will gain a greater understanding of the role that the arts play in the social, cultural, economic and political lives of Indigenous peoples. This course envisions art not as something that merely reflects experience, but as a tool that is used to create new forms for imagining and shaping the world. During the term, we will examine how artists, novelists, historians, anthropologists, art historians and others have contributed to an interdisciplinary dialogue about Native American art and material culture.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-30-21
Native American Studies Program,NAS,31,Indians in American Literature,"Indians are uncanny absences in the American narrative and yet persistent fixtures in our national literature from its origins to the present day. This course examines the pervasive appearance of the seductive, strange, and evolving Indian figure in works by prominent American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, James Fenimore Cooper, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Willa Cather, and Toni Morrison. We will explore the shifting and ideological role of the Indian as tragic emblem, savage defender, spiritual ally, and modern foil. We will explore the complicated ways that the literary Indian has served to both authenticate and trouble the nation's founding narratives and desires, and more recently, to stand as a mythical antidote to postmodern crises of value, economics, ecology, and spirituality. We will consider the appeal of such tropes in particular regional and historical contexts, such as the Reconstruction South, as well as racial or ethnic ones, such as the African American appropriation of Indian resistance, nobility, and genealogies.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-31
Native American Studies Program,NAS,32,Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native American Literature and Film,"This course explores the abundant crime fiction and murder mysteries by contemporary Native American artists. These works imagine a democratized space where colonial violence is avenged, American law is malleable, and intellect triumphs over racism. While most critics applaud such decolonizing efforts, we will ask more difficult questions: do these sensational narratives do real cultural work? Do they suggest that colonial violence begets only more violence? And in the end, who are its true victims?

Native American Studies Program,NAS,34,Native American Oral Traditional Literatures,Native American oral tradition constitutes a rich and complex dimension of the American literary heritage.  This course will examine a range of oral genres from several time periods and tribal sources.  Oral traditions and the textual sources into which they are anthologized provide valuable insights into the nature of human creativity.  They are also full of unique hermentical challenges.  This course will include some contemporary theoretical approaches to orality and the metaphysics of the voice to unpack some of these questions.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-34

Native American Studies Program,NAS,36,Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty,"This course focuses on the legal and political relationship between the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand and their respective colonial governments. Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples' experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice. Not open to first-year students without permission of instructor.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-36

Native American Studies Program,NAS,40,Language Revitalization,"There is currently a measurable reduction in the amount of linguistic diversity around the world as many languages become moribund or cease to be spoken. With greater awareness of language endangerment and attrition, there have been counteracting efforts to maintain and revive the use of many of these languages. In this course we examine the phenomena of language endangerment and language revitalization. We will evaluate the socio-historical reasons for language shift, the rationale for language revitalization and the relative degrees of success in different revitalization programs. There will be a focus on the languages of North America.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-40
Native American Studies Program,NAS,41,Native American Literature and the Law,"The Acoma Pueblo poet Simon Ortiz once noted that ""because of the insistence to keep telling and creating stories, Indian life continues, and it is this resistance against loss that has made life possible."" The regenerative and reaffirming force of tribal stories has been most severely tested when confronted by the overwhelming and often destructive power of federal law in Indian affairs. The complex matrix of legal and political relations between Indian tribes and the federal government thus serves as a singularly important arena to examine contested notions of national identity, sovereignty, relationships to lands and people, and concepts of justice. Students will read literary texts produced by Native authors and legal texts involving Indian tribes in an effort to understand how the Native production of stories contributes to the persistence of tribalism in contemporary Native America.

Native American Studies Program,NAS,42,Gender Topics in Native American Life,"This course will address a range of topics concerning gender that are of particular significance to indigenous communities.  These topics will be considered from historical, political, cultural and social perspectives.  In the context of this class, the term “indigenous” is a category that includes tribal nations of the United States including Hawaii, the First Nations of Canada, and the indigenous people of Australia and New Zealand.  The material is presented with particular concern for the diversity of indigenous groups and the variety of their own experiences and autochthony.  We will explore their responses to misconceptions of tribal gender roles and identities projected upon Native people by the agents and institutions of settler colonialism.  This approach opens a broader discussion about the many actions of indigenous communities to deconstruct and decolonize gender categories that are alien to the continuity, integrity, and vitality of their own traditions.  The interdisciplnary approach of this course will engage texts from philosophy, literature, semiotics, history, and policy, as well as gender studies from various socio-cultural perspectives.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-42
Native American Studies Program,NAS,44,"Indigenous Law, the State & Legal Pluralism","This course focuses on Indigenous law and legal systems, primarily from the United States but with some attention to the jurisgenerative (or law-creating) roles of Canadian First Nations and Australian Aboriginal Peoples. For Indigenous peoples, the resurgence of traditional Indigenous laws and their accompanying legal  structures serves as an important marker of indigenous self-determination and nation (re)building. At the same time, these developments challenge the long-standing hegemony of the nation-state, particularly the centrality of the state's legal system and the presumption that the state is the sole author and arbiter of law. The resurgence of Indigenous law and legal systems, in short, tests the limits of legal pluralism, the notion that two or more legal systems can co-exist peacefully in shared territories.

We explore how their poetry contributes to the reclamation and continuity of tribal memory and the regeneration of tribal traditions and communities. Our course includes lyric voices from the reservation, from the city, and from indigenous spaces in dyasporic and global contexts.  We will examine the combined influences that oral tradition, ritual life, and tribal values have on these contemporary poets.   The indigenous poetic voice occupies a unique position in contemporary American poetry, but also in the discourse of settler colonialism. This course traces how the themes of these poetic voices bring forward images of past and contemporary experience, to craft a poetic tradition that is distinctly indigenous.

Native American Studies Program,NAS,50,Federal Indian Law,"This course will focus on the constitutional, statutory and jurisprudential rules of law that make up the field of Federal Indian Law. Attention will be given to the historical framework from which the rules were derived. After outlining the respective sources and limits of federal, tribal and state political authority in Indian Country, the course will turn to a consideration of subject-specific areas of law, including criminal justice, economic development, environmental and natural resource regulation, hunting and fishing rights, Indian child welfare and preservation of religious and cultural rights.

Native American Studies Program,NAS,51,Pan-Indianism in American History,"This course provides the history of pan-Indian movements in Indigenous North America from 1680 to the present. In the current era of self-determination, tribal sovereignty, and Indigenous nationhood, we perhaps sometimes forget that pan-Indian movements have played a significant part in the history and experiences of Native peoples of North America. We will explore the many ways in which Native peoples have aligned themselves with other tribal nations religious, military, educational, economic, and environmental movements, in the process cutting across linguistic, cultural, religious, and national lines. Indigenous North Americans have deployed pan-Indianism as a strategy to confront both international such as colonialism and the struggles for control of contested Borderlands, and more regional and localized forces. Taken in its entirety, understanding pan-Indianism is essential to understanding the history of Native North America.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-51

Washington's world and his life intersected constantly with Native America. He spent much of his life surveying and speculating in Indian lands. He got a crash course in Indian diplomacy at age twenty-one and his mishandling of Indian allies sparked the French and Indian War. He participated in two expeditions against Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh) and defended the Virginia frontier against Indian attacks. His break with Britain stemmed in large part from Crown policy that threatened his investments in Indian land.

Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-56

This course engages various texts that feature Bear imagery in traditional stories, songs, and ritual representations-all vehicles that transmit both sacred and practical knowledge. We use readings in mythopoetics, performance narratives, nature writing, some early ethnographic accounts and recordings, environmental literature, and the contemporary writing of several Native American authors. Discussion about the tribal significance of the Bear is a means to examine ontological distinctions between human self and animal being, and the constructions of human consciousness within the natural world. We also discuss how concepts of ""wildness"" and ""wilderness,"" and ideas about ""control"" and ""freedom"" are expressed within imaginative and geographical spaces.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Native-American-Studies/NAS-Native-American-Studies/NAS-80-01
Native American Studies Program,NAS,81.03,Pen and Ink Witchcraft: Native American History Through Treaties,"Treaties enabled European colonists to establish a foothold in North America and charted the territorial expansion of the United States. Indian people were often deceived by treaties and they referred to them as ""pen and ink witch-craft."" But the hundreds of Indian treaties generated unique records of cultural encounter. Each treaty had its own story and cast of characters. Working with the records of key treaties, this seminar will examine the protocols of Indian diplomacy, the maneuverings and agendas of the different participants, as well as the outcomes and legacies of Indian treaties.

Philosophy,PHIL,1,Introduction to Philosophical Topics,"Students will engage with central topics, debates and methods in philosophical inquiry. Emphasis is placed on developing critical reading and analytical writing skills.  Readings may draw on both historical and contemporary sources.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1
Philosophy,PHIL,1.01,The Problems of Philosophy,"This course acquaints the student with some of the fundamental problems in at least three main areas of Philosophy: Theory of Knowledge, Metaphysics, and Ethics. Questions treated in lectures normally include: Can we know anything, and, if so, how? Does God exist? What is the relation between mind and body? Are our actions free or determined? What makes an act morally right or wrong? Some attention will be paid to the ways in which answers to these questions can be combined to create philosophical systems or total world views. The readings might include both contemporary essays and classic works by such philosophers as Plato, Descartes, and Hume.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-01
Philosophy,PHIL,1.02,Existentialist Ethics,"Inescapable freedom – this is what the existentialists held to be the mark of the human condition.  Despite this shared view, however, they each proposed distinct and novel ways of understanding this freedom and its ethical import. To uncover the richness of their analyses of the human condition, the class will explore the complexity of freedom through the lens of core existentialist topics such as radical responsibility, transcendence, nothingness, alterity, inter-subjectivity, finitude, and the absurd.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-02
Philosophy,PHIL,1.03,Philosophy and Economics,"What makes an economic system fair or unfair?  What does it mean to be economically rational?  How should we evaluate public policy?  How do we know when things go better or worse for a person?  This course will explore a range of fundamental issues in ethics and political philosophy that have deep implications for economic analysis including distributive justice, well-being, and rationality.  It will also examine philosophical perspectives on economic efficiency and social choice theory.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-03
Philosophy,PHIL,1.04,"God, Darwin, and the Cosmos","This course will examine the relation between science and religion. The course will consider evolution, creationism, and intelligent design. Topics will include the compatibility of Darwinism and theism, and the question whether “Intelligent Design” is a scientific theory. The course will consider questions such as ‘Is the Big Bang evidence for or against the existence of God?’ and ‘Is the fact that the universe is life-permitting evidence for the existence of God?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-04
Philosophy,PHIL,1.05,"Reasons, Values, Persons","We will consider such questions as:  What makes a life worth living?  What makes a life a good life?  What, if anything, makes a life a meaningful life? What, if anything, are the grounds of values? What is a person? What relation, exactly, do you bear to the person who first enrolled in this course?  What is freedom? Are you free?  What, if anything, do personhood, freedom and morality have to do with one another?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-05
Philosophy,PHIL,1.06,Classic and Experimental Philosophy,"What is God and does she exist? What can we know and what should we believe? Do we have free will? What action is the morally right action? Who or what deserves our care and concern? These fundamental questions about human existence have gripped deep thinkers, from bearded sages to college students, for centuries. What makes this course unique is that we explore these questions and others through readings from traditional philosophical texts and experimental approaches, to see how these questions can be approached by both philosophical and psychological perspectives.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-06
Philosophy,PHIL,1.07,"Life, Death, Relationships, and Meaning","In this course we will philosophize about what is valuable and how to live a life, asking how our answers to those questions are affected by the fact that lives don’t go on forever.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-07
Philosophy,PHIL,1.08,Philosophy of Time & Time Travel,"On the one hand, time is completely familiar.  On the other, it is a total mystery.  As you might expect, the combination makes for good philosophy.  In this course, we will study a variety of philosophical puzzles concerning the nature of time.  Is time an illusion?  Does time pass?  Is the present special?  Is time travel  possible?  Do the past and future exist? Does time have a direction? What is spacetime?  What are the special and general theories of relativity? What do they imply about the nature of time?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-08
Philosophy,PHIL,1.09,"Science, Superstition, and Skepticism","Most of us believe that matter is made up of atoms, that smoking causes emphysema, and that the universe is billions of years old. Few believe that Virgos are hot-tempered, that you can see the future through a crystal ball, or that baking soda cures AIDS. We often hear that the difference between such beliefs is that one sort is based on science and the other isn’t. But what makes a method of inquiring into the world distinctively scientific? And what makes us justified in believing on the basis of these methods? This course is an introduction to the philosophical theory of knowledge that focuses on the knowledge that science is purported to offer. Possible topics include competing theories of justification, scientific induction, the nature of explanation, probability, scientific ‘revolutions’, the goals of science, trust in scientific authority, and skepticism.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-09
Philosophy,PHIL,1.10,"Minds, Meanings, and Images","Most things don’t mean anything. How is it that the contents of language and mental states can mean something? How do images represent or depict their objects? What do different answers to such questions tell us about the nature of minds, consciousness, and representation? What do different answers presuppose about reality and our capacity to know it? This course will focus on historical answers to such questions with an eye toward comparing common reference points in contemporary philosophy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-10
Philosophy,PHIL,1.11,"True, Beautiful, Nasty: Philosophy and The Arts","Art is often cast as a pleasant distraction, but artists are lionized, ostracized, imprisoned, and even killed. Devotion to sub-genres of music, video games, literature, and street art builds and divides communities. What explains the role of the arts, and artists, in society, and what should their role be? How do positive (nice!) and negative (nasty!) aesthetic responses affect art’s function? Might art be an important, yet non-scientific, approach to understanding our world?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-11
Philosophy,PHIL,1.12,Philosophy and Tragedy,"Since antiquity philosophers have concerned themselves with tragic drama and its world-view. Why is this powerful and peculiar art-form regarded as both a rival to philosophy and also a site of significant philosophical activity? What philosophical insights or ethical developments are made possible through the depiction of suffering and grief? How does tragedy impact our understanding of human agency and the place of fate and chance in human life? Authors considered may include Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Racine, Beuchner, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Camus, Miller, Nussbaum, Williams.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-12
Philosophy,PHIL,1.13,The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B. Du Bois,"This course will examine the historical philosophy of the towering Black scholar and great freedom fighter of the 20th Century. We shall engage in close readings of Du Bois’ classic work, “The Souls of Black Folk” (1903) as well as subsequent essays in his magisterial corpus, especially his classic autobiography, “Dusk of Dawn” (1940).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-13
Philosophy,PHIL,1.14,"Knowledge, Truth, and Power","How does and how should social position – race, gender, class – affect our beliefs? What roles does trust play, and ought it to play, in knowledge? How is power implicated in what we can know and in who can be epistemic authorities? Are some agents unjustly epistemically disadvantaged, and if so, how? How ought we to shape our communal interpretive resources? Social epistemology is the study of socially shared beliefs. Some of its core concerns include testimony, disagreement, and the nature of group commitment.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-14
Philosophy,PHIL,1.15,Selves and Stories,"Humans are narrators, making sense of themselves and their world. But what are narratives and how do they function? How do narratives engage emotions, desires, and imagination? What sorts of elements belong to narratives? What role does narration play in self-construction? Is it important to have ‘a life-story’? Are narratives an important part of authentic or ethical living? How do narratives differ from other forms of communicative or literary expression? How do individual narratives and social narratives interact? Can narratives serve as arguments or reasons or justifications or explanations? How do narratives figure in human inquiry, human agency, and moral responsibility?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-15
Philosophy,PHIL,1.16,"Morality, Freedom, and the Mind","In this course, we will focus on classic philosophical questions about morality, freedom, and the mind. We all have to address moral questions in our everyday lives, but how should we go about answering them? What makes actions right and wrong—is it the consequences of the action, or the principle followed, or something else? We all feel like we are free when we make important decisions. But does it make sense to think we might have free will, given that we are natural creatures, in a world governed by deterministic physical and biological laws? If we don’t have free will, can we be held morally responsible for our actions? Finally, we all think of ourselves not just as physical beings, but as thinking things—as beings who are aware of our world, who have beliefs, thoughts, and hopes. But what is the mind—and what are beliefs, thoughts, hopes? Can the mind be understood as identical with the brain, or mental events as events in the brain? If not, how can talk about the mental be understood? We will examine a variety of approaches to these three central topics through both historical and contemporary philosophical texts.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-16
Philosophy,PHIL,1.17,"Race and Modernity: W.E.B. DuBois, James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry","This course will examine the classical works of three towering modern intellectuals: W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Lorraine Hansberry. We will wrestle with the rich formulations, subtle arguments, and courageous visions of three Black thinkers who continue to speak with power and passion to our turbulent times.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-17
Philosophy,PHIL,1.18,"The Self in Philosophy, Psychology, and Neuroscience","What makes you, YOU? Is it the sum of your memories, or your brain, or perhaps an immortal soul? In this course, we will cross the centuries together to examine ancient and modern theories of personal identity in philosophy and consider also current empirical perspectives from the cognitive sciences. You will discover canonical readings from historical and contemporary sources in multiple philosophical traditions and discuss how famous clinical cases challenge our thinking about the self.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-1-18
Philosophy,PHIL,3,Reason and Argument,"An introduction to informal logic with special attention to the analysis of actual arguments as they arise in daily life as well as in legal, scientific, and moral reasoning. Along with the analysis and criticism of arguments, the course will also consider the methods for constructing arguments that are both logically correct and persuasive. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-3
Philosophy,PHIL,4,Philosophy and Gender,"This course will focus primarily on the following questions:  What is feminism?  What is sexism?  What is oppression?  What is gender?  Is knowledge gendered?  Is value gendered?  What is a (gendered) self? What would liberation be?  In exploring these issues, we will examine the ways feminist theorists have rethought basic concepts in core areas of philosophy such as ethics, social and political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of law, and philosophy of mind. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-4
Philosophy,PHIL,4.01,Feminist Perspectives on Reproductive Ethics,"This class focuses on ethical issues concerning human reproduction.  Some of these issues are familiar: Is abortion moral?  Is sex-selection ethical?  Other issues may be less familiar:  Does prenatal testing express a negative message about living with disability?  Is there anything wrong with aiming to have a deaf child? Yet other issues have arisen with the commercialization and globalization of reproduction: Is there anything wrong with selling one’s reproductive labor? Is it ethical to ‘outsource’ pregnancy to Indian surrogates? We will start by looking backward to ethical issues around the introduction of contraception; we will end by looking forward, to the promise of same-sex reproduction through in vitro-gametogenesis, and reproduction via artificial gestation.  While we will consider numerous perspectives on each issue, special consideration will be given to feminist viewpoints.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-4-01
Philosophy,PHIL,5,Philosophy and Medicine,"An examination of some philosophical issues in the field of medicine. Primary focus will be on the moral issues that arise in dealing with individual patients, e.g., paternalism, informed consent, euthanasia, and abortion. There will also be an attempt to clarify such important concepts as death, illness, and disease. Open to all.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-5
Philosophy,PHIL,6,Logic and Language,"This course introduces contemporary sentential logic and predicate logic. Both the theory of logic and its application to ordinary language are developed. Topics include symbolization, truth tables, truth trees, interpretations, and derivations. Each week one lecture, three quiz days, and three afternoon individualized discussion sessions are offered (normally MWF 4:45-5:15pm). The individual discussion sessions allow students to pursue their questions and obtain feedback on quizzes on a one-on-one basis. The self-pacing aspect of the course allows students who have difficulty to receive more assistance and those who do not need as much assistance to move ahead more quickly. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-6
Philosophy,PHIL,7,First-Year Seminars in Philosophy,,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-7
Philosophy,PHIL,8,Introduction to Moral Philosophy,"An introduction to the foundations and nature of ethics. Questions may include:  What is the good life? What is it for something to have value? Are there acts that ought never to be done, no matter the consequences? Is ethics objective or relative to different perspectives? We inevitably make assumptions whenever we offer ethical verdicts about particular cases. This course aims to think systematically about those assumptions. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-8
Philosophy,PHIL,9,Applied Ethics,"An examination of the ethical dimensions of some contemporary controversies. Topics will vary from year to year but may include: business, death, discrimination, the environment, gender, law, media, race, sex, technology, and war. The course may be taken more than once for credit with permission of the instructor. Open to all classes. No prerequisites.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-9
Philosophy,PHIL,9.01,Reproductive Ethics,"What do we owe human life, once it has begun to develop? Is a woman morally required to continue gestating a fetus, once it has begun developing?  Does the answer depend upon whether or not the fetus is a person?  Some forms of assisted reproduction yield a surplus of human embryos.  Is using these embryos for research moral? Is it moral to dispose of them?  What may we do in the interest of creating human life?  We tend to grant people broad procreative liberty. Should deaf couples be allowed to select for deafness?  And what about choosing enhanced traits for our children?  Some people worry we are facing a future where the rich can design their babies – choosing to create a musical prodigy or a baby Einstein – but the poor cannot.  If so, is distributive justice the only concern about such a future?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-9-01
Philosophy,PHIL,9.02,Environmental Ethics,"This course provides a general introduction to ethical problems concerning the environment. The course will cover some standard positions in the field, including biocentrism (the thesis that all living organisms have intrinsic moral worth) and ecocentrism (the thesis that entire natural systems have intrinsic moral worth). Topics considered may include:  the ethics of food; the ethics of climate change; the moral status of non-human animals; population, consumption, and sustainability; GMOs and organic food; our duties to other persons, including future persons; and the difficulty of formulating comprehensive climate policy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-9-02
Philosophy,PHIL,9.04,The Ethics of Food Choice and Food Policy,"In this course, we will consider ethical questions for food production, food consumption and food policy. How do ethical values interact with our food choices? Should we support the production of local and organic food? If so, why? If not, why not? Are there compelling moral reasons to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet? Is it possible to be an ethical omnivore? Do current production practices or food policies have a disproportionately negative impact on some populations? How, if at all, should practices or conditions in the food industry influence our behavior as consumers? In the course of our discussions, we will consider the ethics of harm, distributive justice, complicity, death and obligations to future generations.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-9-04
Philosophy,PHIL,9.06,"Friends, Lovers, and Comrades: Ethical Issues of Special Relationships","This course will investigate philosophical issues that arise in our relationships with other people. What kind of attitude is love? What makes someone a genuine friend? Is partiality to one's friends and family morally justifiable? Is patriotism? What are the moral responsibilities of sex? Readings from classic and contemporary sources, including Plato, Aristotle, Pufendorf, Hume, Kant, Freud, and Beauvoir.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-9-06
Philosophy,PHIL,9.07,"Ethics of Freedom, Paternalism, and Intervention","We will begin by considering foundational issues in the morality of attempts to steer actors (people as well as states) towards better outcomes.  We apply the resulting theories to concrete issues such as speech, health, drugs, guns, dangerous pursuits, incarceration, and intervention in the affairs of other nations.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-9-07
Philosophy,PHIL,9.08,Ethics and Information Technology,"How do we understand moral agency and moral responsibility in the context of the internet?

Philosophy,PHIL,11,Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy,Students will study the origins of Western philosophical thought as it emerges in classical Greece and Rome from 6th century BCE through the 4th century CE. Topics may include: the methods and value of philosophy; the fundamental nature of reality; the possibility of knowledge; the roles of logic and mathematics in inquiry; philosophy of biology; philosophy of medicine; moral psychology and human action; virtue and human flourishing; political philosophy; fatalism; death.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-11
Philosophy,PHIL,12,Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy,"Inspired by classical philosophy, Jewish and Islamic thought, and Christian doctrine, medieval philosophy (from, roughly, the 4th-15th centuries) strives to reconcile its various influences while making creative contributions and great strides in philosophy of religion, logic, natural philosophy, philosophy of mind and metaphysics. The late medieval period paves the way for intellectual revolutions in the philosophy of science, philosophy of religion and political theory of the Renaissance period (roughly the 14th – 16th centuries).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-12
Philosophy,PHIL,12.01,Medieval Philosophy of Language and Reality,"Does language mirror reality? Are linguistic expressions reliable guides to truth? If not, why not? If so, how can we best approach the study of reality through language? Medieval philosophers make great strides in logic, semantics and metaphysics in their attempts to answer such questions. Topics considered in the course may include signification, the logic of predication, the nature and number of categories, analogy, substance and accident, existence and essence, universals, and the status of relations.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-12-01
Philosophy,PHIL,13,Early Modern Philosophy,"Early modern philosophy is western European philosophy mostly of the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes indicated as spanning from the early writings of Descartes (c. 1619) to the publication of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781). It encapsulates the break from prior Scholastic and Renaissance traditions in philosophy and science and becomes hugely influential in setting the agenda of western philosophy—in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics, political philosophy, etc.—through the 20th century and up to today.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-13
Philosophy,PHIL,13.01,17th Century Rationalists,"A study of central themes in the works of the three most celebrated philosophers of the seventeenth century: Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. Metaphysics and epistemology will be our focus, and the topics we’ll explore include mind, matter, necessity, contingency, truth, causation, space, time, knowledge, reason and the existence of God. We’ll approach their philosophy through a variety of their texts, in English translation, including treatises, papers, dialogues, letters and unpublished drafts and notes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-13-01
Philosophy,PHIL,13.02,British Empiricism,"The Empiricists believed that concepts and knowledge are sourced exclusively in the senses. This position found its most detailed presentation in John Locke (1632-1704), George Berkeley (1685-1753), and David Hume (1711-1776). It led to a picture of the mind, how it relates to the world, and how this leads to knowledge that is still influential today. This course develops that picture, with an eye to the philosophical context in which it came about and its influence on subsequent generations. In addition to Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, other (mainly British) writers considered might include Thomas Hobbes, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, Catharine Cockburn, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Damaris Masham, Frances Hutcheson, Thomas Reid, and Mary Shepard.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-13-02

Philosophy,PHIL,16.01,Self-Consciousness in German Idealism,Our theories of action and knowledge are condemned to fail if they are not guided by a philosophically fundamental inquiry into the nature of self-consciousness.  Kant maintains a modest version of this thesis.  Fichte and Hegel make it the key to their ambitious systematic philosophies.  This course aims to isolate and evaluate the basic insights that animate German Idealism.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-16-01
Philosophy,PHIL,16.02,"Kant on Moral, Legal, and Political Philosophy","According to Kant’s influential account of morality, how an agent understands her own actions determines their moral status.  An act that is innocuous in its external guise might be morally problematic because of its internal principle.  Kant supplements this with an account of how we ought to relate to other persons in external respects.  This “doctrine of right” offers a compelling alternative to more widely known political and legal philosophies.  This class will provide a unified introduction to both parts of Kant’s attempt to understand the normative implications of agency.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-16-02
Philosophy,PHIL,19,History of 19th/20th Century Philosophy,"This course treats philosophical topics and figures in the rich and influential period that spans the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics may include: subjectivity, agency, power, atomism, idealism, positivism, critiques of metaphysics, ideology, psychologism, the unconscious, intentionality, consciousness, analysis, naturalism and modality. Prerequisite: One course in philosophy or permission of the instructor.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-19
Philosophy,PHIL,19.01,Wittgenstein,"An investigation of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy, its sources, and its enduring significance. The main line of the course traces the logical atomism of his early years through his rejection of it as dogmatic and the subsequent development of his thoughts about meaning, mind, language games, and rule-following. Other topics might include his philosophy of mathematics, his remarks on color, or his aesthetics and value theory.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-19-01
Philosophy,PHIL,19.02,Transcendental Philosophy in Husserl and Heidegger,"Transcendental philosophy seeks to uncover conditions for the possibility of experience. This course will study the ways in which Husserl and Heidegger develop and refine Kant’s transcendental project in the course of their phenomenological investigations, in part by broadening the range of human experience that is subject to philosophical scrutiny. Time will be one focus of the course, as we seek to reconstruct Heidegger’s claim that different conceptions of time yield different understandings of what it is to be.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-19-02
Philosophy,PHIL,19.03,Positivism and Ordinary Language Philosophy,"As the natural sciences developed and branched off from philosophy, philosophers faced the question: What is left for philosophy to do? This crisis led philosophers in the positivist and ordinary language traditions to reexamine the role of philosophy, the boundaries between the meaningful and the nonsensical, and the possibility of metaphysics. In this class, we will study the motivations, methods, and results of each approach, as well as examining prominent criticisms raised against them.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-19-03
Philosophy,PHIL,22,Feminism and Philosophy,"This course examines the relationship between feminism and philosophy. The focus is on such questions as: Is the Western philosophical canon inherently sexist? How should feminist philosophers read the canon? Are Western philosophical concepts such as objectivity, reason, and impartiality inherently masculinist concepts? The course may focus on either the ways in which feminists have interpreted great figures in the history of philosophy (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche), or on the ways in which feminists have rethought basic concepts in core areas of philosophy (e.g., epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, political philosophy, philosophy of science), or both. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-22
Philosophy,PHIL,23,Art and Aesthetics,"What is art, and what’s the point of it? Does it help us understand the world better or enjoy it more? Does art distract us from what is really important? What is beauty, and ought the arts aim at producing it? What are representation, expression, and realism, and how do they figure in different art forms? The course addresses combinations of these questions through both reading philosophy and engaging with artwork.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-23
Philosophy,PHIL,23.01,Ethics and the Arts,"From novels, films, and television to painting, sculpture, and symphonies, the influence of art on our character, our values, and how we see the world is pervasive. This raises a number of important philosophical questions at the intersection of ethics and the philosophy of art. Do both moral properties like goodness and aesthetic properties like beauty exist only ""in the eye of the beholder"", or are one or both of them more objective? Can we learn things about what is good and right, or how to be better people from reading great literature or seeing important paintings? How might the moral character of a work of art affect its aesthetic merit? Is Birth of a Nation, for example, a worse film because of its racism?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-23-01
Philosophy,PHIL,23.02,Philosophy and the Cinematic Arts,"Moving images introduce new questions and problems in philosophy of art, and they offer new perspectives on old ones. How does film differ from the other arts? Do moving images represent time, and if so, do they do it in a pictorial manner? In what critical, aesthetic, and representational respects does cinema differ from theater, painting, and the other mimetic arts? Did cinema introduce new possibilities for realism into artistic practice? How should we understand the tangled relationship between photography and cinema? How does the study of moving images relate to problems in other areas of philosophy, like the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-23-02
Philosophy,PHIL,23.03,Art and Its Nature,"What is the nature of art? Can ‘art’ be defined, or do attempts at definition illegitimately constrain creative innovation in the arts? What sorts of things are paintings, songs, or works of literature? How are they related to things such as colored canvases, scores, the cultural context, artists, and audiences? Are there important differences in kind among arts like painting, literature, and music? This course will investigate these and other questions about the definition and ontology of art.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-23-03
Philosophy,PHIL,24,Law and Philosophy,Legal practice raises a wide range of questions of interest to philosophers.  Some concern how best to understand central concepts invoked in laws:  What are contracts? What is free speech? Other questions concern what kinds of laws and legal institutions we should have: What kinds of laws should regulate hate speech? When is the state justified in using coercion to enforce laws?  Still other questions concern law itself: How are legal norms related to moral norms?,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-24
Philosophy,PHIL,25,Philosophy of Cognitive Science,"What is the mind and how can we model it? Cognitive science offers a distinctive approach to some of the great philosophical questions about the mind. But what does it tell us? This course will cover the classical foundations of cognitive science, and some of the more recent developments in the field. We will study the computational theory of the mind and its implications, connectionism, theories of embodiment, dynamical systems, and recent statistical approaches to cognition. (Not open to students who received credit for PHIL 010/COGS 11.01.)",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-25
Philosophy,PHIL,26,Philosophy and Computers,The accomplishments of artificial intelligence research and the widespread use of computers in our society confront us with many interesting philosophical questions. What are the limits of artificial intelligence? Could computers ever think or feel? Is the Turing test a good test? Are we really computers? Are there decisions computers should never make? Do computers threaten our privacy in special ways? This course will consider such issues in order to explore the philosophical implications of computing. Open to all classes.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-26
Philosophy,PHIL,27,Philosophy of Science,"In this course students examine the history, practices, methods and assumptions of the natural and social sciences. Topics may include:  the objects and methods of scientific inquiry; causation and explanation; the structure and function of laws and theories; the role of mathematics and models in science; scientific representation; induction and probability; scientific revolutions; the intersections of science and value; and the sociology of science.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-27
Philosophy,PHIL,28,Phenomenology and Existentialism,"This course examines the traditions of phenomenology and existentialism, primarily through a study of German, Austrian, and French philosophy from the first half of the twentieth century, but also including more recent work inspired by these traditions. Major historical figures covered in this course may include: Franz Brentano, Edmund Husser!, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Emmanuel Levinas. Special topics may include: the nature of subjectivity or consciousness; theories of intentionality; phenomenology and post-phenomenology; historicity; freedom and responsibility; existentialist theories of oppression; and existentialist ethics.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-28
Philosophy,PHIL,28.01,Heidegger's Being and Time,"This course will focus on Heidegger’s Being and Time. Topics to be discussed include: the foundations of metaphysics, knowing-how vs. knowing-that, agency, practical reason, social identity, social ontology, philosophical methodology, and the phenomenology of everyday experience.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-28-01
Philosophy,PHIL,28.02,Phenomenology and the Mimetic Arts,"Phenomenology offers a distinctive approach to philosophical problems because it is centered on unpacking the structure and content of experience. This course introduces students to phenomenological methods, and then focuses these techniques on the mimetic arts. The arts of imitation – figurative painting and sculpture, photography, film, theater, and so on – are particularly phenomenologically interesting. Experiences of them are complex because they involve awareness of the representations as well as what they represent, among other things. As such, they are both excellent candidates for phenomenological analysis, as well as test cases for phenomenological methods. This course will consider both classical and contemporary thinkers in the phenomenological tradition, as well as their critics.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-28-02
Philosophy,PHIL,29,Philosophy of Logic and Mathematics,"Logic and philosophy of mathematics are ancient fields of study and have also flowered in recent times. Courses in this rubric study principles, results and methods of logic (whether in 'classical' or 'non-classical' systems) or philosophical issues concerning the interpretation of logic and mathematics (e.g., what justifies the rules of inference? what is mathematics about? what is logical or mathematical truth? what does a proof prove?). Emphasis may be historical or contemporary.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-29
Philosophy,PHIL,29.01,Of Time and Necessity: Philosophy of Logic,"Often we reason about what is now, actually the case. But often we also reason about what was or will be. Or about what could or might or would have been; or about what must be, even if some things could have been otherwise. What are the correct rules for this? What, if anything, makes them correct? We shall develop some elementary parts of modal and temporal logic and consider their interpretation and philosophical significance.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-29-01
Philosophy,PHIL,29.02,The Infinite,"Infinity is an indispensable concept for mathematics. Arithmetic deals with infinitely many natural numbers, geometry with infinitely long lines, calculus with infinitely small changes, and set theory with multiple levels of infinity. But the infinite raises distinctive philosophical problems. Just what is our concept of the infinite? A completed totality larger than any finite totality? Something that extends beyond all bounds? What justifies us in applying this concept? Are there larger and smaller levels of infinity? How many? Moreover, how are we to deal with the paradoxes that arise from the concept? The infinite also has a related, but arguably distinct use in certain philosophical debates where it is used to denote ideas of perfection or completeness, e.g. of the divine or human reason. What is the relationship between this notion of the infinite and its use in mathematics? Readings will include historical and contemporary sources, from Aristotle to Cantor to today.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-29-02
Philosophy,PHIL,30,Epistemology and Methodology,"This course deals with the nature of inquiry.  Which methods of inquiry should we rely on? Can we know or understand anything? Of what value are knowledge and understanding?  Topics covered may include skepticism, the methodologies of science, mathematics and philosophy, the social nature of knowledge, self-knowledge, the nature of memory and knowledge of the past.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-30
Philosophy,PHIL,31,Metaphysics,"This course will focus on one or more central topics in metaphysics, possibly including the existence and nature of the divine, the infinite, free will, personal identity, the self, actions and intentions, space and time, change, the nature of properties, truth, necessity and modality.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31
Philosophy,PHIL,31.01,Space and Time,"In this course, we will consider some historically significant questions about the nature of space, time and spacetime. How are space, time and change related? Is space some kind of substance or container for events? Or is space a relation between things? Is time mind-dependent? How, if at all, is motion or persistence through space and time possible? Are the past, present and future equally real? Is time travel possible?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31-01
Philosophy,PHIL,31.04,Realism and AntiRealism,"In this course, we will explore a portion of the complex web of debates between realists and antirealists.  Questions we will consider include: What is realism? On what bases do we commit to the existence of something? To what extent, if any, are objects of experience and inquiry (e.g. colors, values, natural laws, numbers) independent of the mind? What role, if any, does the mind play in the construction or conception of meanings, properties or things? What role does language play in determining ontological commitments? What is truth? What, if anything, do distinct conceptions of meaning, objectivity and truth suggest about the nature of reality or about the mind's capacity to determine or to know what is real?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31-04
Philosophy,PHIL,31.05,"Time, Truth and Fate",If it’s already true that I’ll die in an avalanche tomorrow or else that I won’t—logic says it’s one or the other—is it pointless to take precautions? Is everything fated to happen as it does? Is the future open? Can we change the past? Is anything real apart from the present? Does the present exist? Does the truth about time require different rules of logic? We’ll draw on sources from Aristotle to today.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31-05
Philosophy,PHIL,31.06,"Free Will, Agency and Responsibility","What sorts of agents are we? Do we have free will? Are we ever truly the authors of our actions? Does science—whether physics or psychology or neuroscience—promise to give us the answers? What are the consequences for moral responsibility? The metaphysical, scientific and social dimensions of these classic questions in philosophy run deep through their history and are focal points of contemporary discussion.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31-06
Philosophy,PHIL,31.07,The Social World,"Our world is rife with social entities such as money, states, clubs, and corporations. But what are these things? They seem as real as trees or mountains, yet at least some seem to be constructed by our beliefs and practices in ways that other physical things are not. This course explores questions about what social objects and social groups are, how they differ from natural objects, and how we can acquire knowledge of them.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31-07
Philosophy,PHIL,31.08,Puzzles of the Material World,"The world around us seems to be populated with familiar objects of all sorts: plants and animals, tables and chairs, rivers and mountains. Yet a range of puzzles and paradoxes have been raised to do with the vagueness of ordinary objects, their relationship to the matter that makes them up, and the apparent rivalry between scientific and everyday descriptions of the world. Might ordinary objects be an illusion? What does the material world truly contain? Can we save our common-sense view of the world?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-31-08
Philosophy,PHIL,32,Intermediate Logic,"An investigation of three branches of symbolic logic: first-order predicate logic with identity, sentential modal logic, and predicate modal logic. Topics to be covered may include Russell's theory of definite descriptions; the treatment of non-denoting terms in logics known as ""free logics;"" investigations of various modalities, involving pairs of concepts such as necessity and possibility, being obligatory and being permitted, and being known and being believed; Kripke-style ""possible world"" semantics.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-32
Philosophy,PHIL,34,Language and Thought,"Studies of language and cognition play central and defining roles in the history and development of philosophy. Students will investigate the nature of language and its relations to logic, thought and reality.  Specific topics may include theories of signs, meaning, reference, truth, and speech acts.  Other possibilities include necessity, analyticity, tensed statements, counterfactual conditionals, indexicals, pragmatics, metaphor, intentionality and vagueness.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-34
Philosophy,PHIL,35,Mind and Psychology,"The mind is both a part of the world and the source of our perspectives on it. A variety of approaches to understanding the mind consider such questions as: What is consciousness? What is it to think about things? How does the world as we know it through the sciences allow for conscious, thinking creatures to exist? Are there unconscious thoughts and desires? Can psychology, neuroscience, philosophy and psychiatry help us answer these questions?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-35
Philosophy,PHIL,35.01,Theories of Consciousness,"Conscious experience is at once both completely familiar and utterly mysterious: how is it that electrical activity in a lump of grey matter – the brain – gives rise to the Technicolor phenomenology of our conscious experience? If human beings are just biological machines, then how is possible that we have a subjective point of view on the world? Why are we not just mindless robots, that produce behavior in light of stimulations from the environment, but lack any inner awareness or consciousness? In this class we will read, and bring together in conversation, cutting edge work from philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences on the nature of consciousness.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-35-01
Philosophy,PHIL,36,Metaethics,"This course explores foundational questions about ethics.   For instance: What, if anything, makes an ethical judgment correct? Are ethical facts created or discovered? Can ethical judgments ever be objectively true, or are they only true ""from a point of view?"" How are ethical judgments related to natural science and the picture of the world it offers us? How can we come to justified beliefs about ethics?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-36
Philosophy,PHIL,37,Ethical Theory,"This course is broadly concerned with questions about what is right, good and virtuous.  Some instances of the course will treat abstract questions.  For example: Are moral principles universal or relative to a particular group? Is an act right just in case it maximizes happiness? Do we have good reason to be moral? More focused instances might include: Do we have duties to non-humans? When is it morally permissible to kill a person?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-37
Philosophy,PHIL,37.01,Consequences and Contracts,"Ethical theory begins with questions about the foundations of morality: Why should I care about other people at all? It then asks very general questions about what shape our duties to self and others should take: Given that I owe something to other people, do I owe them pleasure? Happiness? To help them pursue their projects? To solicit their consent? This class is devoted to two systems of answers to these questions. The first, consequentialism, holds that the moral status of an action is primarily a matter of whether it brings about good or bad consequences. The second, contractualism, understands moral principles as grounded in a hypothetical contract between agents.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-37-01
Philosophy,PHIL,38,Social and Political Philosophy,"Through the study of classical and contemporary texts in political and social theory, we will consider such issues as how and to what extent (if at all) political authority can be justified, what the criteria are for distributive justice, and how social and political inequalities (such as those based on race and gender) should be conceptualized and addressed.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-38
Philosophy,PHIL,38.01,"Equality, Justice, and Democracy","What is the nature of equality? How much does equality matter in ethics and politics? And why (if at all) does equality matter in the first place? This course concerns these and related questions about the role of equality in evaluating the social and political world. One of our central concerns will be how equality relates to other (purportedly important) ethical and political values, including justice, democracy, and freedom.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-38-01
Philosophy,PHIL,38.02,"Ethics, Politics, and the Law","This interdisciplinary course will examine normative issues about ethics, politics, and the law. Specific question studied might include the following: When is the state justified in using coercive force to secure compliance with the law? How should we proceed with those who disagree with us about normative questions within a democratic, pluralistic society? Are there correct answers to normative questions at all, and (if so) how might we improve in learning about them?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-38-02
Philosophy,PHIL,39,Critical Theory and Post-Structuralism,"This course examines themes in 20th and 21st century French and German philosophy, with a focus on critical social theory of the Frankfurt School and French post-structuralism, and contemporary work inspired by these traditions.  Figures covered in this course may include:  Adorno, Horkheimer, Habermas, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, and Honneth. Topics may include:  the dialectic of enlightenment; the critique of power; the Frankfurt School; structuralism and post-structuralism; and the problem of modernity.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-39

Philosophy,PHIL,45.01,Paradoxes and Puzzles,"Paradoxes have played influential roles in philosophical investigations since antiquity. Paradoxes figure both in arguments for important philosophical theses and in (alleged) refutations of substantive positions. This course considers a selection of celebrated paradoxes along with important attempts to solve them. Students will consider topics in a variety of fields, possibly including philosophy of language, logic, ethics, decision theory, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical methodology.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-45-01
Philosophy,PHIL,45.02,"God, Belief, and Evil","God is supposed to be a perfect being: all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good. Famously, there are 'proofs' of God's existence, and 'proofs' to show the opposite. What should we think? This class explores the question of God's nature and existence, and what it means for human belief and action. What are the divine attributes? How strong are the arguments for or against God's existence? Can religious belief be rational? How could a perfect God permit evil? Can there be morality without God?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-45-02
Philosophy,PHIL,45.03,Consent in Philosophy and Law,"What is consent? Despite its enormous moral and legal centrality, the idea of consent seems flawed in important ways. It is not obvious what counts as consent, or what makes it reasonable to believe in consent. Consent can be coerced, or unwilling. Ideally, consent and refusal are instantaneous powers conferring recognized permission or obligation on recipients. In real life, however, particularly for women, consent and refusal can be ignored, dismissed, misunderstood, or deemed irrelevant. We will examine the concept of consent in legal theory and moral philosophy to move towards a better understanding of it in sexual contexts.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-45-03
Philosophy,PHIL,45.04,Embodied Cognition,"This course critically examines approaches in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science that see our psychological capacities as importantly dependent on our bodily form and abilities, and our environmental surroundings. We will examine how this view of mind as essentially ‘embodied and embedded’ arose in reaction to the classical ‘cognitivist’ paradigm in cognitive science that understands psychological capacities in terms of computational processes implemented by the brain, consider various ways in which the body and environment might contribute to explanations of cognition, and look at the prospects and challenges for embodied cognitive science in various domains.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-45-04
Philosophy,PHIL,50,Advanced Seminar in Philosophy,This course may be offered in any term and the content varies; see individual topic descriptions.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50
Philosophy,PHIL,50.09,Personal Identity and the Self,"What sorts of beings are we? Embodied psychologies? Thinking animals? Moral agents? Narrative constructs? The metaphysical questions are abiding ones because of their intrinsic interest, and also because of their rich connections to developing theories of human biology, psychology, value, freedom, and agency. We will investigate which features, if any, are essential to the sorts of beings we are. We will ask after the grounds for existence and persistence of such beings across time (e.g. biological capacities, self-reflective capacities, rational agency). We will consider models of self-constitution, self-knowledge and self-deception. If time permits, the course will conclude with an exploration of the impact of psychological fragmentation on personhood, self-constitution and agency.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-09
Philosophy,PHIL,50.14,"Property, Markets, and Capitalism","Property is a fundamental topic in political philosophy, legal theory and the social sciences. This course integrates philosophical theories of property rights with social scientific perspectives on social cooperation and economic perspectives on private law.  It explores the implications of recent work in these areas for broader questions about economic inequality, the fairness of market outcomes, constitutional limitations on state authority, and the proper balance between private control and public regulation.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-14
Philosophy,PHIL,50.15,Neuroethics,"The brain is the seat of who we are. This course will examine ethical issues that arise from our growing understanding of the brain, and our consequent ability to monitor and manipulate it. We will discuss timely issues such as cognitive enhancement, the ethics of brain interventions, drugs, and neural gene therapies, and the possibility of mindreading. Later in the course we will examine the ways in which our growing knowledge of the biological basis of moral cognition may or may not have effects on our moral theorizing.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-15
Philosophy,PHIL,50.17,Global Expressive Rights,"Does the right to free speech have boundaries? Philosophical defenses of the right to free speech, developed in the context of the town square and the printing press, have yet to catch up with the revolution in communication brought about by the Internet. Technological innovations such as social media have made it possible to communicate instantaneously with hundreds of millions of people around the world and have, for purposes of regulating speech, rendered national boundaries virtually irrelevant. There is now an urgent need to determine how to assess and protect the values of free speech in this global context. Questions we will discuss include: Is there a universal human right to freedom of expression? If so, what is the philosophical basis for it? What are its limits? Does it protect racist hate speech as well as political dissent? How should the different free speech regimes currently in effect in different countries be reconciled in cases of conflict?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-17
Philosophy,PHIL,50.18,Animal Minds,"This course focuses on questions about the minds of nonhuman animals. We will consider what kind of thought, if any, is possible for beings that lack language. Can animals have propositional thought? What limits are there on the contents of nonlinguistic thought? We will also consider other aspects of mentality: Can animals feel pain? Can they suffer? Are they conscious? Finally, we will consider the ethical implications of the answers we find to the above questions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-18
Philosophy,PHIL,50.20,The Social Mind,"This course addresses the question of how we understand other people’s behaviour.  It examines contemporary philosophical theories concerning how we think about another’s thoughts, and related questions such as whether this ability is unique humans, universal across cultures, and how it may develop.    The course is strongly interdisciplinary, drawing on sources from developmental psychology, neuroscience and anthropology, to support philosophical arguments.  However, no prior knowledge of these fields is required to take the course.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-20
Philosophy,PHIL,50.21,Current Research in Social/Political Philosophy,"What kind of society should we aim to have? And why should we aim to have that kind of society as opposed to some other kind? And are there objectively right answers to these two previous questions, or are there ultimately only answers that are correct relative to a given social/historical framework? These three abstract questions have long been at the heart of social/political philosophy, from Aristotle and Plato to the present day. They are also questions that matter tremendously to a wide range of citizens in our increasingly globalized world: a world in which different societies, with different cultures, different social/political structures, and different moral values come into increased contact with other. This course will be focused on these three interconnected questions. It will be an advanced discussion-based seminar, and will involve multiple visiting speakers. All students will be expected to have at least two previous courses in philosophy or in political theory.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-21
Philosophy,PHIL,50.22,Value,"What is it for something to be valuable or disvaluable?  Are there irreducible truths about value?  Are knowledge and achievement per se valuable?  Or can their value ultimately be explained by the value of happiness?  Are persons valuable in a way that cannot be captured by the sum total of their happiness, knowledge, and the like?  What role should truths about value play in ethics as a whole?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-22
Philosophy,PHIL,50.23,Virtue Ethics,"Contemporary virtue ethics arises out of a long and illustrious history in which ethics focuses on moral character traits. Do virtues (e.g. honesty, courage) exist? If so, what are they? Are they dispositions grounded in nature, traits acquired by education and training, or some combination of both? How are virtues related to practical deliberation, action and emotions? How are virtues related to human flourishing? How promising is virtue ethics relative to other approaches in normative ethics?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-23
Philosophy,PHIL,50.24,Moral Epistemology,"Ethical disagreements range from the ethics of abortion to foundational questions about the basic structure of ethics (such as whether or not consequentialism is true). What is the significance of such disagreements for deciding what to believe in ethics? Do moral disagreements provide support for moral skepticism? How, if at all, can we make progress in ethical inquiry? Parallel questions, as they arise in other domains (e.g. mathematics, political philosophy, and epistemology itself) will be examined.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-24
Philosophy,PHIL,50.25,Moral Sentimentalism,"Sentimentalists believe that moral judgments are based on affective states—roughly, emotions—and that the institution of morality is in some sense a construction out of these states. What are the origins of moral approbation and disapprobation? Is there such a thing as a “moral sense”? What role does sympathy or empathy play in moral psychology? How are moral sentiments related to practical deliberation? Are moral judgments the product of reason or passion? How do complex moral attitudes evolve? What role do social forces play in shaping moral sentiments? Is there empirical evidence for or against sentimentalism? What are the implications of moral sentimentalism for non-cognitivist approaches to moral discourse? Readings will include both classic sentimentalist texts of the 18th Century—Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith—and their latter-day descendants.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-25
Philosophy,PHIL,50.26,Philosophy and the Quantum World,"Many striking claims have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics—that the future is undetermined, that an object can be in two places at once, that consciousness has a special causal role, that the future can affect the past, and so on. Quantum mechanics is an incredibly powerful theory; but it is also a deeply troubled theory, and it is far from obvious what it says. In this course we will study quantum theory, its central difficulty (the measurement problem), and options for avoiding the difficulty. We will also evaluate philosophical claims that have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics. No acquaintance with modern physics will be presupposed.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-26
Philosophy,PHIL,50.27,Categories,"What is there? What are the most fundamental kinds of beings and how are they related to nonfundamental beings? Is it possible to develop a system of categories to identify the highest genera of being and to map the basic structure of reality? Do categories sort extramental entities or concepts or cognitive structures? Are they determined by logic or language? Philosophy is rich with competing attempts to develop categorical systems of reality, cognition, and meaning. This course will examine both historical and contemporary approaches to categories and their importance, including skeptics of the entire undertaking. Authors to be considered may include Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Ockham, Suárez, Kant, Frege, Husserl, Heidegger, Ryle, Chisholm, Strawson, Dummett, Westerhoff, Lowe, and Brandom.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-27
Philosophy,PHIL,50.28,Philosophy of Time,"In this seminar we will explore the nature of time and temporal phenomena. Topics include: Does time pass? Do the past and future exist? What light does special relativity shed on the nature of the present? Is an object fully present at a time, or only a temporal part of it? What explains the temporal asymmetries of our experience? Could the world be fundamentally non-temporal?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-28
Philosophy,PHIL,50.30,Freedom of Expression,"What does it mean to express oneself? Are there special reasons not to limit people’s freedom of expression? If protecting freedom of expression is profoundly important, does this mean that even hate speech (for example) must be protected? What limits can there be? These are some of the questions we will take up in this class. The first part of the course will study foundational questions about the nature and value of freedom of expression. The second part of the course will then examine specific topics including obscenity, pornography, hate speech, privacy, and corporate speech. We will conclude with a critical discussion of several recent Supreme Court decisions on freedom of expression.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-30
Philosophy,PHIL,50.31,Classics of Modern Aesthetics,"This course introduces students to philosophical aesthetics and the philosophy of art through some of the central works of those fields from the 18th Century onwards. Potential questions include: the nature of aesthetic pleasure, the special features of aesthetic judgments, the beautiful and the sublime, the moral potential of art, the relationship between art and freedom, the characteristic aims of art, what makes an experience aesthetic, and the role of symbolism in the arts.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-31
Philosophy,PHIL,50.32,Love and Respect,"Morality seems to involve distinctive attitudes toward other people-distinctive ways of feeling and regarding other people. What are these distinctive attitudes of moral consideration? In this course we examine two candidates: love and respect. We will consider both the question of what these attitudes ultimately involve, when and why they are merited, and the prospects for moral systems built around them.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-32
Philosophy,PHIL,50.33,Necessity and Possibility,"Modal talk is central to a great range of philosophical discussions, in areas from ethics to metaphysics to philosophy of mind and philosophy of science. But talk about what is possible or necessary is puzzling. For, as Hume noted, we never seem to observe anything like necessity in the world. Can talk about what is necessary or possible be true or false? If so, are there parts of reality (other possible worlds, or essences or modal properties of this world) that make it true? Or should modal talk be understood as doing something other than attempting to describe features of the universe? And how can we come to acquire modal knowledge—given that we don’t seem to observe modal facts? This course will examine a range of positions in the metaphysics and epistemology of modality.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-33
Philosophy,PHIL,50.34,Experiencing Time,"Perplexity about the nature of time has evolved in lock step with worries about temporal experience. Somehow, we experience time passing, we differentiate now from later and before, and we do all of this while passing through time. Experience of time can be a window onto time itself, but that window might be muddy. Perhaps we fail to understand time because of how we experience it, or perhaps the best way to understand time is to attend to how we experience it.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-34
Philosophy,PHIL,50.35,"Mind, Language, and Morality","This course examines questions about the connection between mind, language, and normative domains such as morality, politics, and law. For example: how should we understand normative language that seems to be fundamentally about prescribing ways of acting, rather than about describing reality? Are moral judgments more a matter of emotion, or of belief? Can we reconcile a commitment to moral objectivity with our best scientific understanding of moral thought and talk? This course will engage such questions from a fundamentally interdisciplinary perspective, engaging with work from philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. In so doing, we will explore how empirical work can inform philosophical inquiry, and how philosophical inquiry can continue to guide ongoing research in the cognitive sciences. Students will be encouraged to work in interdisciplinary teams to create their own co-authored research.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-35
Philosophy,PHIL,50.36,Propaganda,"Communication pushes people around. Sentences, stories, pictures, graphs, and maps can all convey information. But they can also convince, enthrall, enrage, (dis)empower, and (de)humanize. This course focuses on how communicative acts and ideologies have this power. It considers some linguistic, political, epistemological, psychological, and aesthetic aspects of such acts. And it considers examples of the phenomenon as diverse as political ads, literature, film, painting, pornography, slurs, compliments and even course syllabi.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-50-36

Philosophy,PHIL,80.01,Kant's Critique of Pure Reason,"A close study of this epoch-making work, which has set the agenda for many sub-fields of philosophy since its publication in 1781.  Kant observes that philosophy, in contrast to mathematics and natural science, cannot point to any results that are acknowledged by all able practitioners.  Thus, philosophy has made no progress.  Kant proposes a method and foundation for philosophy that will change that.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-01
Philosophy,PHIL,80.05,Metametaphysics,"In this course, we will examine the nature and methods of metaphysics. Are ontological debates genuine debates, or do at least some of them involve pseudo-questions or merely terminological disputes? If they are genuine questions, how can we best find answers to them—or must the answers remain unknowable? Is there a privileged conceptual system for revealing the true ‘structure of reality’? We will address these and other questions, with texts from Carnap and Quine through to the present.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-05
Philosophy,PHIL,80.06,Images!,"This course uses tools from the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of art to understand non-linguistic representation and its significance. Topics include the nature of depiction, pictorial realism, mental imagery, maps, diagrams, and models.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-06
Philosophy,PHIL,80.12,"Free Will, Responsibility and the Brain","Do we have free will? Does brain science show that we do or do not? How does moral responsibility depend on freedom? Can we be responsible if we are merely physical mechanisms? Can we blame people for their actions? This course will explore the philosophical questions and neuroscientific literature regarding free will, and will address the implications of this debate for law and society",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-12
Philosophy,PHIL,80.13,"Love, Respect, and Moral Obligation","A survey of closely connected questions about the attitudes of love and respect, as well as the distinctive moral duties associated with each. Questions will include: What is distinctive about the attitudes of love and respect? Do we have universal duties of respect for all persons? If so, what do these duties entail for us? How is the partiality of an attitude like love to be reconciled with the impartiality of respect?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-13
Philosophy,PHIL,80.14,"Kant on Being, Goodness, and Beauty","This course will cover Kant’s accounts of what it is to judge of something that it is, that it is good, and that it is beautiful.  By far the most time will be devoted to the first of these accounts (his so-called theoretical philosophy), since it serves as a foundation for all of the rest.  Coverage of the latter two will focus on how all three accounts are unified in a single system of philosophy.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-14
Philosophy,PHIL,80.15,Epistemic Normativity,"This seminar is on foundational issues in contemporary epistemology, focusing on questions about the nature and grounds of epistemic normativity. Possible topics include: the relationship between epistemic rationality and reasons for belief, whether or not epistemic justification is ultimately dependent on our psychologies or practical interests, the relationship between truth and epistemic justification, and the bearing of general metanormative theorizing on our understanding of normativity within epistemology.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-15
Philosophy,PHIL,80.16,Plato's (Super)Naturalism,"Platonists, ancient and contemporary alike, commit themselves to the existence of abstract, nonphysical, intelligible beings (e.g. numbers, properties, propositions) in addition to concrete, spatiotemporal, perceptibles (e.g. horses, vases, mountains) . For Plato, in particular, changeless, intelligible beings are metaphysically and epistemologically prior to changing, perceptibles.  The supernatural is prior to the natural. We will attempt to reconstruct and to assess (a) Plato’s reasons for positing and privileging supernatural entities; (b) his view of how, if at all, the “two worlds” interact; (c) his view of how, if at all, we are to understand or to explain the natural in terms of the supernatural; and (d) the prospects for “natural science” as Plato understands them.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-16
Philosophy,PHIL,80.17,"Unity, Necessity, Infinity: Themes from Leibniz",This seminar is a study of three great philosophical topics in Leibniz's work and their contemporary counterparts.,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-17
Philosophy,PHIL,80.18,Beauty,"Beauty is the preeminent aesthetic value, and plumbing its depths is one of philosophy's oldest occupations. Is beauty an objective feature of the world or merely ""in the eye of the beholder""? How do we judge something to be beautiful? What is the relationship between beauty and pleasure? Can art be beautiful? Can nature? What is the relationship between beauty and other values, like justice and virtue? Readings may include Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, G. E. Moore, Iris Murdoch, Mary Mothersill, Arthur Danto, and Alexander Nehamas.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-18
Philosophy,PHIL,80.19,Quine,"W.V.O. Quine was one of the most influential and systematic philosophers of the 20th century. His insights have had deep and lasting effects on epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, metaphysics and philosophy of logic. In this class we will work through some of Quine’s most influential papers and arguments, and will try to understand the underlying systematic commitments of his views.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-19
Philosophy,PHIL,80.20,Controversies in Feminist Philosophy,"This seminar explores controversies in contemporary feminist philosophy over such issues as pornography and prostitution, sexual coercion and consent, the social construction of gender, and the intersections of gender with race, class, sexual orientation, disability, and other group-based identities.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-20
Philosophy,PHIL,80.21,Philosophical Methodology,"What does philosophical inquiry involve? What should it involve? What are the best ways to make progress in philosophy? Are the best methods for making progress in one area of philosophy (e.g. metaphysics) different from the best methods in another area (e.g. ethics)? Does the idea of philosophical progress even make sense? This course will address these and other questions about the nature of philosophy and philosophical methodology. Possible approaches to be discussed include conceptual analysis, philosophical naturalism, genealogy, ideology critique, phenomenology, thought experiments, and the a priori.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-21
Philosophy,PHIL,80.22,Secondary Qualities,"Secondary qualities – colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches – raise important problems in the philosophy of mind, epistemology and metaphysics. For many reasons, they seem less objective, and more tied to experience, than the traditionally primary qualities like shapes and masses do. Would colors exist in a world without color perceivers? Would sounds exist without hearers? How do the problems with understanding color relate to those for taste, touch and smell? How are secondary qualities related to primary qualities? This course will consider both historical and contemporary attempts to grapple with the primary/secondary quality distinction.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-22
Philosophy,PHIL,80.23,Philosophy and the Quantum World,"Many striking claims have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics—that the future is undetermined, that an object can be in two places at once, that consciousness has a special causal role, that the future can affect the past, and so on. Quantum mechanics is an incredibly powerful theory; but it is also a deeply troubled theory, and it is far from obvious what it says. In this course we will study quantum theory, its central difficulty (the measurement problem), and options for avoiding the difficulty. We will also evaluate philosophical claims that have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics. No acquaintance with modern physics will be presupposed.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-23
Philosophy,PHIL,80.24,"The Real, the True, and the Vaguely","What is truth? What conception of reality does truth involve? Should we think of truth or reality as transcending the limits of our evidence? Should we conceive of them as always tied to a perspective? Is truth an all-or-nothing matter, or might there be borderline cases? Could there be no definite fact of the matter about the way the world is? We’ll address such questions using historical and contemporary sources.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-24
Philosophy,PHIL,80.25,Imagination,"The study of imagination has a long, rich philosophical history. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest in the topic. In this course, we will consider efforts to understand what imagination is and what role imagination plays in the cognitive and emotional lives of experiencers, inquirers, and agents. How is imagination related to perception, belief, pretense, supposition, and desire? What role does imagination play in emotions and in actions? How free is imagination? Can we imagine the impossible? What do we learn about imagination by considering how we engage (or are resistant to engage) in fictional imaginings? How do imagination and creativity interact? Can we rely on imagination to learn or to come to know something new? If so, how? If not, why not? Readings will be drawn from both historical and contemporary sources.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-25
Philosophy,PHIL,80.26,Conceptual Ethics and Conceptual Engineering,"Some have argued that a central and legitimate job of philosophy involves conceptual ethics and conceptual engineering: that is, work in determining what sorts of language or concepts we should use, and how we should use them. In this course we will examine the motivations for thinking of philosophy in this way. We will go on to consider questions such as: How is conceptual engineering possible, and how could it lead to philosophical progress? To what extent can past philosophical debates be reconceived as involved in conceptual negotiation? What are the signs that conceptual (re-)engineering is needed? How can and should this sort of work be done? What view(s) of concepts are involved in undertaking this work—and is it better to think of this work at the conceptual or linguistic level? What criteria can and should we employ in evaluating concepts, or conceptual systems? Is conceptual engineering even possible—and if so, how can we do it?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Philosophy/PHIL-Philosophy/PHIL-80-26
Philosophy,PHIL,80.27,Marx and Marxism,"An introduction to the thought of Karl Marx and themes from his work. Areas of focus may include Marx’s account of alienation and exploitation, his materialist theory of history, his critique of liberalism, his theory of ideology, his conception of freedom and morality and Marxist analyses of culture. Particular attention will be paid to Marx’s relevance to contemporary questions in social and political philosophy.

Philosophy,PHIL,80.28,"Reasons, Value, and Well-Being","Many otherwise divergent moral theories agree that we have reason to create and sustain value (or “the good”).  How should we understand the concept that plays this central role in ethics?  Might there actually be two different concepts that are often called by the same name?  We face many questions about which sorts of things (pleasure, knowledge, virtue, and beauty) have intrinsic or final value.  Well-being plays a central role in theories of value.  What is well-being?  And what distinguishes it from ‘impersonal’ values, if there are any?

Philosophy,PHIL,87,Research in Philosophy,"The purpose of Philosophy 87 is to provide opportunity for a student to do advanced work on a topic that the student has studied in a regularly offered course, or to study a topic not normally covered in a regularly offered course. In order to enroll in Philosophy 87, a student must prepare a brief (one page) proposal which describes what the student wishes to study and accomplish by taking this research course. All proposals for Philosophy 87 must be reviewed by the faculty of the Department after having been provisionally approved by the faculty member who is the prospective director. This must be done before the beginning of the term in which the course is to be taken.

Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,43,Emotion,"Emotions define human experience. When you ask someone how they are, they tell you how they are feeling. We formulate our life goals in terms of emotions, striving to obtain happiness, while avoiding regret. Emotions such as love, pride, contempt, and shame shape our social relationships, both as individuals and as groups. When our emotions go badly awry, we suffer debilitating mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Although emotions play a central role in our lives, studying them scientifically presents profound challenges. They seem intuitively hidden, elusive, messy, and hard to evoke or quantify in a laboratory. Despite these challenges, researchers have developed a thriving science of our emotional lives, which you will learn about in this course. We will begin by considering the origins of emotion, both biological and cultural. Subsequently we will examine how emotions manifest themselves in our bodies and brains, change dynamically over time, shape our social interactions, influence our cognition, and affect our mental health. Finally, we will consider ongoing theoretical debates in emotion science, and where the field could and should go next.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-43

Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,50.02,Decision Making: Linking Behavior to Brain,"In our daily lives we are faced with many decisions: what to eat for lunch, whether to spend the next hour on Instagram or on homework, or what courses to take next quarter. Some of those decisions require gradual deliberation while others can be made quickly. Nevertheless, to make any decision we rely on external information and what outcomes we expect from those decisions. Decisions are easy to make if information is complete and the outcomes are certain. But how does the brain combine different sources of partial information to make decisions in the face of uncertain outcomes?  In this course we will examine decision making from both behavioral and neurobiological points of view. Specifically, we will learn about different methods used in psychology, economics, and neuroscience (e.g. operant conditioning, game theory, reinforcement learning, prospect theory, electrophysiology, neuroimaging) to study decision making at various levels, from cognitive processes to underpinning neural activity and mechanisms.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-50-02

Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,51.01,The Neuroscience of the mind-body problem,"Neuroscience has learned a great deal about how neurons function, and Psychologists have learned a lot about the contents and processes of the mind. But we lack a deep understanding of the bridge that must link these two sides of the ""mind-body"" problem. We do not yet fully understand (1) how information is processed, transformed and communicated by neurons, (2) how consciousness can be realized in physical neuronal activity, or (3) how mental events realized in physical brain events can be causal of subsequent mental and physical events. This course will focus on what is known about the neural code and the neural bases of consciousness, mental causation and free will and what is not yet understood. We will focus on reading original research articles and chapters from books that attempt to get at these deep and challenging conceptual and empirical issues.  A particular focus will be the relationship of attentional processing to consciousness, and its neural bases.

This course will introduce conceptual frameworks to understand reward as a phenomenon that is distinct from other features of goal-directed behavior. We will then discuss recent advances in neuroscience research that are helping us to understand the basic brain mechanisms that make things pleasurable, including anatomical pathways, neurotransmitter systems, and dynamics of neural activity.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-80-01
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,80.02,Neuroeconomics,"Neuroeconomics is an emerging field in which a combination of methods from neuroscience, psychology, and economics is used to better understand how we make decisions. In this seminar course, we learn about economic and psychological theories that are used to investigate and interpret choice behavior, and mental and neural processes that underlie decision making. We also examine how recent neurobiological discoveries are used to refine decision theories and models developed in psychology and economics. During this course, students will read and discuss the most current research findings in neuroeconomics. They will also learn to develop new ideas/hypotheses and design experiments to test those ideas/hypotheses, or to use their knowledge to inform society about the implications of findings in the field of neuroeconomics.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-80-02
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,80.04,The Weight Among Us: What Neuroscience Can Teach Us About Obesity,"In 1995, ~56% of adults in the US were overweight or obese. Fast-forward ~25 years and the prevalence has increased to 70%. Over this time period there have been significant advances in the scientific understanding of obesity, yet many questions remain unanswered. In this course, students will examine, through the lens of neuroscience, how successes, failures and challenges in obesity research inform the prevention, management, and treatment of obesity.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-80-04
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,80.05,"Mind, Brain, and Health","What does the mind have to do with physical health? In this course, we explore the idea that the mind and brain influence physiological processes related to mental and physical health alike. How we conceptualize ourselves and our place in the world sets the stage for how we interpret life events and make decisions. This conceptualization also governs how our bodies respond to stressors and other environmental conditions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-80-05
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,81.04,Neural Basis of Human Imagination,"The capacities that set humans apart in kind, not just in degree, from all other known animals include, in part, capacities and propensities for art, music, analogical reasoning, abstract thought, creativity, the spontaneous generation and use of symbols, the ability to reason abstractly about others and about events, as well as the ability to manipulate symbols recursively and syntactically. This course will explore the hypothesis that all these modes of human behavior and cognition share a common root cause in our brains. We will focus in particular on the human capacity to imagine. We can, for example, construct a representation of a thing, say an airplane, or an event, say a planned party, and then go about making real that which we imagined. How is this capacity to imagine and creatively plan realized in the brain? Where did it first appear in the human lineage? What is the relationship of imagining to other important capacities, such as attention, volition, consciousness, planning and executive control? The goal of this course is to try to answer such questions by reading empirical and theoretical papers and chapters that try to account for what it is that makes the human mind human, by looking at distinctive aspects of processing in the human brain.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-81-04
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,81.08,Animal Cognition,"Can rats empathize with others, or experience regret? Can birds grasp the intentions of others, or imagine the future? Do dogs deliberately deceive their human companions? This seminar will explore the cognitive abilities of a range of animals through the careful analysis of behavior, defining rigorous and measurable criteria for inferring complex behaviors, and contrasting them with simpler alternatives. We will draw on neural data, asking if phenomena such as creativity, mental time travel, and theory of mind can be detected based on the observation of brain activity. Finally, we will consider questions relevant to human health: can mice become schizophrenic, chronically depressed, or develop post-traumatic stress disorder? Lively discussion in the classroom is encouraged.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-81-08
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,81.09,Storytelling with Data,"In a world plagued by “alternative facts” but flush with “big data,” how can we find truth? For example, can truth be objectively defined, or are there many equally valid truths?  And does truth depend on the question we’re asking, or is it a fixed property that we could somehow uncover with the right analysis?  These sorts of question align with other deep questions about how we can really “know” something.  For example, can we really ever hope to prove that the universe works in a particular way?  If so, how?  Or if not, what’s the point of observing the world around us at all, or of becoming a scientist?  In this course we will define truth from a (somewhat cynical, but embarrassingly practical) psychological perspective: truth is the story about data that others find most convincing.  To that end, we will examine (from this psychological perspective) tools and strategies for finding patterns in complex datasets, crafting convincing stories about those patterns, and communicating them to others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-81-09
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,81.10,Neural Bases of Attention and Consciousness,"This course will cover the relationship between volitionally attending and consciousness, particularly in the domain of human visual processing. By consciousness we mean that which is currently subjectively experienced. The relationship between attention and consciousness appears to be very tight; that which we choose to attend to we are conscious of, and that which we are conscious of we could choose to attend to in the next moment. We will examine what is known about the neural bases of the different types of attention, with a particular focus on 'endogenous attention,' which is the mode of attending that is under volitional control. We will at the same time examine what is known about the neural bases of visual consciousness, with a particular focus on those aspects of neural processing that are modulated by volitionally attending to a stimulus or not. In addition to one main text (""The Quest for Consciousness"" by Christof Koch) we will read scientific papers that place useful constraints on the neural bases of volitional attention and visual consciousness.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-81-10
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,81.11,Real-World Scene Perception,"We experience our visual environment as a seamless, immersive panorama. Yet, each view of this environment is discrete and fleeting, separated by expansive eye movements and discontinuous views of our surroundings. How does the brain build a unified representation of an immersive, real-world visual environment? This course will discuss the scientific literature of real-world visual scene understanding.  The topics we will cover in this course cut across human, animal, and computational studies, addressing questions such as: What are the circuits and mechanisms that enable the recognition of a visual scene from just one glance? How are the representational dimensions of visual scenes mapped onto the surface of the brain? How can our understanding of human scene perception guide machine vision systems?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-81-11
Psychological and Brain Sciences - Undergraduate,PSYC,83.07,The Problem of Other Minds,"Success in a social world requires understanding other people’s thoughts and feelings. Yet, other people’s mental states are not directly observable: you cannot see a thought or touch a feeling. Nonetheless, humans are actually quite proficient in inferring these invisible, internal states of mind. How do we accomplish these mind-reading feats? This course will address this question, which is known as ‘the problem of other minds.’ We will tackle ‘the problem of other minds’ from multiple angles, relying heavily on neuroscience and psychology research, as well as a few foundational papers from philosophy. Specifically, we will address questions such as: Do specialized portions of the brain accomplish mental state inference? When do mind-reading skills develop in children and are humans the only species that can represent other minds? Why do some people, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), experience difficulties in understanding others? What leads to biases in mental state inference, such as anthropomorphism  (when people attribute mental states to inanimate objects) and dehumanization (when people under attribute mental states to humans)?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-Psychological-and-Brain-Sciences/PSYC-83-07

Quantitative Social Science,QSS,30.12,Quantitative Literary Criticism,"Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies. Assigned readings will be in English translation using bilingual Latin-English editions; in addition to reading all of the English, students with Latin will be responsible for understanding and translating “micro samples” of the original texts.

Students interested in further study of these and related topics are referred to the courses listed in the Mathematics and Social Sciences program.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Quantitative-Social-Science/QSS-Quantitative-Social-Sciences/QSS-36

Quantitative Social Science,QSS,54,Chasing the (Causal) Dragon: Intermediate Quantitative Data Analysis for Sociologists,"Sociologists and other social scientists are often interested in understanding causal and dynamic social processes such as:
\f“How do the places we live, work, and play get under the skin and affect health and well-being across the life course?”
\f“Does upward social class mobility change one’s political attitudes?”
\f“What social currents are responsible for changes in support for same-sex marriage across historical time?” 
\f“Are long-standing racial inequalities declining, persisting, or increasing in recent years?”
\fMany of these questions are methodologically difficult to answer with observational (non-experimental) data, and they require that we get a handle on the study of change, context, and causality. You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists’ methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.
\fIn this course, we’ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going “under the hood” and more focused on “how to drive”—specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals. The course will culminate in an independent research project where students will analyze data and use the one or more of the modeling techniques discussed during the term to answer a sociological research question of their choosing. SOCY 10 or equivalent and a basic understanding of STATA is required to enroll in this course.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Quantitative-Social-Science/QSS-Quantitative-Social-Sciences/QSS-54

Russia is a continental power of vast proportions whose traditions, character, national myths, and forms of political organization often seem a mirror-image to those of the United States. After a brief survey of Russian history, the course will examine certain determinants of Russian culture, including Christianity, multinationalism, and the status of Russian civilization on the periphery of Europe. The course will then deal with the art, music, and popular literature of Russia, and conclude by examining certain contemporary issues, including the complex coexistence of Russian and Soviet culture.

Russian Language and Literature,RUSS,11.03,How the Hammer and Sickle Gave Way to McDonalds,"We will explore a wide variety of domestic and foreign media including film, music, jokes, detective novels, and streaming online videos across the Soviet period and into the present time. Artistic disciplines during the Soviet period were firmly entrenched within cultural industries that featured union memberships, the means to control production, distribution, and exhibition. Nonetheless, what was popular throughout Russo-Soviet history did not always emanate from state guided channels. How do we account for what we perceive as “anomalies” in Russian popular culture: why did people listen to American jazz music under Stalin? Why were Bollywood films more popular than Soviet comedies? Why were Brazilian and Mexican telenovelas standard viewing in Soviet homes? How did the presence of foreign texts relate to the multi-ethnic makeup on the Soviet Union? How were founding mythologies of the nation encoded/rejected in domestic texts?   While popular culture encompasses a multitude of media, special attention will be paid to trends in music and cinema, offering students a comprehensive, historical arc of each medium’s development in Russia. The course will seek to establish a working definition of what we actually mean by “Russian popular culture.” Firstly, how do we differentiate between categorizations of mass culture versus popular culture? Secondly, we will challenge the notion of national culture when referring to the terms “Russian” and “Soviet” culture throughout the semester. Each unit is organized around the construct of “svoi” (“ours”) vs. “chuzhoi” (“theirs”), offering the class a point of comparison for how domestically produced culture often rivaled official foreign imports and blackmarket, unofficial distributed products. We will also explore larger, universal questions that revolve around top-bottom and bottom-up models of how popular culture operates. What does popular culture mean in the capitalist market context, and how might that definition change under socialism?",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-11-03

As we move from the familiar genre of the riddle to the often mystifying beliefs and rituals of the ancient Slavs and then to the fairy tale, comfortingly familiar from childhood, we will learn to not only recognize the richness and density of texts that may initially seem uncomplicated but also to discern the patterns and meanings behind the apparently exotic narratives and behaviors. By thoroughly studying one of the world's richest oral traditions, Slavic folk life and folklore, we will acquire the tools and techniques necessary for collecting, documenting, and interpreting folklore -- which is perhaps the most truly international of all arts.

Russian Language and Literature,RUSS,14,The Age of Brainwashing: A History of Russian and Eastern European Film,"An interpretive history of Russian, Soviet, Post-Soviet and Central European film. Topics include: tsarist Russia and the psychological school of the silent film (Evgeny Bauer); the Revolution and the Golden Age of Soviet montage (Sergey Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov); Stalinism and film as an instrument of mind control and propaganda; late Soviet symbolist cinema (Andrey Tarkovsky); and contemporary Russian Film Noir. The course also touches upon Eastern/Central European film, including the Czech New Wave (surrealist animator Jan Svankmeyer) and the ""post-Yugoslavian wave"" (Emir Kusturica and Dusan Makoveev). In addition to regular weekly screenings, all films will be made available online in an experimental format: divided into separate short clips that will be used in class for in-depth analysis and close cinematic readings.

This course will examine those areas in the study of culture and of language pragmatics with relevance to such communication between American and Russians. Readings and class discussions will focus on such phenomena as 'culture' and 'language' shock; the linguistics and cultural evidence for differences in the two countries' views of such phenomena as time and space, as well as for such concepts as public and private 'spheres,' friendship, or of what constitutes a conversation. A variety of sources from literary works, TV documentaries and film, to travel handbooks and the conduct of negotiations will be examined for the cultural and language script they subsume in the two countries.

Russian Language and Literature,RUSS,31,The World as Word: 19th Century Russian Fiction,"In his Philosophical Letters, Pyotr Chaadaev, a 19th century Russian intellectual, compared Russian history to the history of Western civilization. Chaadaev proclaimed that Russia had been cut off from the global community, belonged to no cultural system, and contributed nothing to the progress of the human spirit. Since then, Russian writers and thinkers have wrestled with Chaadaev’s categorical verdict. One response from the 20th century poet Osip Mandelstam pointed out that Chaadaev had overlooked one singular contribution: the Russian language. “Such a highly organized, such an organic language is not merely a door into history, it is history itself.” Taking Mandelstam’s point to its logical conclusion, it is Russia’s literature that becomes the Rosetta stone to the exceptional nature of the Russian experience. In this course, we will explore some of the texts that make up this Rosetta stone. While reading some of the most celebrated works from 19th century Russian fiction – texts by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Goncharov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov – we will attempt to account for the distinct character of Russian literature and its unique role in Russian history and culture.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-31

As we read and discuss novels, stories, poems, and plays written by the Russian writers of that time, we will consider the correlations and tensions between the Russian sociohistorical reality and artistic expression. In addition to readings from literary and historical sources, we will watch films created by some of the most celebrated Russian filmmakers as a well as the recent controversial documentary The Soviet Story produced by Latvian director Edvins Snore.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-32

Revolted by a world in which innocent children suffer, Dostoevsky tested the meaning to be found in Christianity, personal responsibility and human solidarity. This course examines his major novels, with particular emphasis on the artistic expression of his philosophical views. Those views will be examined in the context of Russian intellectual and literary history. Readings include ""Notes from Underground,"" Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov. Taught in English.

Russian Language and Literature,RUSS,36,The Seer of the Flesh&quot;: Tolstoy's Art and Thought,"From childhood to the end of his life, Tolstoy struggled to overcome his fear of death. As he himself put the problem, ‘Is there any meaning in my life which the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?’ In his quest for bulwarks against that fear, he studied the great philosophers and he examined closely the value system of the peasants. He found temporary relief in war and in marriage, but the definitive solution always eluded him. The evolution of this theme, and the formal devices by which Tolstoy expressed it in his prose, will be traced in the major novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina. The course will conclude with a brief examination of the prose that Tolstoy produced after his conversion. Taught in English.

Course participants will then be asked to script their own one-act plays using the Chekhovian style.

In this course, we will examine those individuals and phenomena that wink insistently from the margins of the historiography – madmen, holy fools (iurodovy), shriekers (klikushi), sectarians, and fanatics – to discover that they are in fact not so marginal to Russian history after all. Among the questions that our course will ask: how is our determination of what is “mad” dependent on cultural norms? Do different societies generate different types of madness? To what degree are Western psychological theories and models relevant to non-Western cultures? What are the uses of madness from a social, political, and literary point of view? Our course approaches these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective and uses recent historical scholarship, foundational texts in individual psychology and psychoanalytic theory, as well as literary works by Russia’s greatest writers to illuminate the dark heart of madness.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-Russian-Language-and-Literature/RUSS-38-04

Four years later, it had vanished from the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since that stunning collapse. Drawing on a wide variety of resources in English translation—from Russian films and novels to YouTube videos and social media posts—you will navigate the diverse technologies and media products that are helping to shape contemporary Russian identity. You will explore, for example, the ‘violent entrepreneurship’ of oil oligarchs, the cynicism of state-funded television propagandists, and the avant-garde theatrics of Moscow’s feminist dissidents. Your study of Putin’s Russia should also allow us to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing citizens in a democracy today: What is the nature of truth in the digital age?

We will read selected Russian, Ukrainian (and other) literary texts and examine them from the perspective of a writer rather than a reader or a critic. We will also explore semantic, stylistic, and poetic resources of language through a variety of experimental assignments. Finally, each student will undertake their own creative writing project, which will center on a specific literary genre and a specific topic chosen as the cultural-historical focus for the course. For the Fall of 2017, this topic will be the 1960s-70s in Ukraine, which, at that time, was part of the Soviet Union. Each student will write one short story, set in 1960-70s Ukraine, and written from the perspective of an imaginary, yet historically grounded, narrator. The reading list for the course will include some of the best short stories written in the Russian and the Ukrainian languages as well as collateral texts and films of various genres devoted primarily to the 1960s-70s in Ukraine and the Soviet Union.

Russian Language and Literature,RUSS,38.10,Modern Conspiracy: The Russian and American Conspiracist Traditions,"Conspiracy narrative has come to dominate our national and international political discourse like no other time in modern history. It is therefore essential that we understand the operation of conspiracy narrative, its psychological allure and political function, and its devastating social consequences. In this course, we will investigate two national conspiracist traditions, the American and the Russian, and the parallel rise and stunning convergence of Russian and American conspiracism in our current political moment. In order to do so, we will inquire into the historical origins, the form, function, and effectiveness of conspiracist narratives in these two traditions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ultimately we will approach conspiracy theories as ways of knowing, of penetrating and ordering complex and opaque realities. They are also powerful narrative weapons that imperil the shared truths on which cohesive societies are based.

Social Science,SSOC,1,War and Peace in the Modern Age,"This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society's social movements and how the characteristics of states' domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Social-Science/SSOC-Social-Science/SSOC-1

How do they organize political authority and economic power? How do they coordinate work? How do they socialize people to ""fit in"" with those around them? How do they produce popular culture? This course provides answers to these questions in ways that provide an introduction to the field of sociology. It focuses on a broad range of theory and research showing how sociologists think about and study these questions. In many cases, the topics covered in the course reflect the research interests and course offerings of faculty in the sociology department at Dartmouth. As a result, the course also provides an introduction to some of the curriculum offered in the department.

Sociology,SOCY,2,Social Problems,"Daily news reports direct much of our attention to social problems such as crime, poverty, prejudice and political corruption. Yet rarely are such reports accompanied by a discussion of the systematic causes of these problems. More often we become witness to an endless stream of media coverage reporting seemingly isolated incidents. Seldom are we informed of the decision-making process by which some social problems become selected for coverage, while others are ignored. The purpose of this course is to subject the coverage of modern social problems to an in-depth, critical analysis. We will attempt to answer such questions as: ""how does a social problem become defined as such?"" and ""what are the causes or sources of various social problems?""

This course examines how social scientists answer this question by exploring a variety of contemporary theoretical perspectives, including those that focus on how conflict, functional needs, individual self-interest, cognitive perceptions, culture or symbolic interpretations organize society. Students compare, contrast and evaluate these and other theories of social organization in light of empirical studies that have tried to explain the genesis and dynamics of groups, formal organizations, social classes, nation states and global systems.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-16
Sociology,SOCY,20,"Sex, Death, and Migration – Or How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Population) Bomb","The world’s population will more than double from 7 to 16 billion by 2100. In addition, some countries’ populations are booming whereas others face rapid decline. What does this mean for public policy, population health and aging, fertility and reproductive health, immigration and social inequality? To gain insight into these questions, social scientists study some of life’s most intimate moments – sex, illness and death, and moving from home to home. These components of population change (mortality, fertility, and migration) help us better understand the impact of population composition and change. In this class, we will first learn the basic tools that social scientists use to analyze broad population trends. We will then use these tools to gain insight into population patterns across the globe. At the end of the course, students will apply what they learned to the analysis of the population trends of a country of their choice, as well as compare and contrast population trends across different countries.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-20

Sociology,SOCY,22,The Sociology of International Development,"This course will introduce students to the major sociological perspectives on economic and political development, with emphasis on developing countries. Among the views to be considered are modernization, which assumes that later developing countries will follow paths once traveled by today's advanced countries; and dependency and world system theories, which view the integration of less developed countries into the world market as problematic and, under certain conditions, even disadvantageous. We will test these theories by applying them to specific cases. A major part of the course will focus on the economic 'miracle' of East Asian countries, as well as cases that have not been so successful. Other important topics to be studied include the influence of states, markets, and multinational corporations in economic development; the relationship between different modes of development and income distribution; and political development and the prospects for democratization.

Sociology,SOCY,32,The Social Meanings of Home,"This course is an exploration of the economic, cultural, social and political dynamics of ""home"" in contemporary U. S. society. The concept, ""home"" invariably invokes multiple and sometimes conflicting ideas-a physical dwelling, family, economic property, birthplace, nationality, environment, haven, etc. We speak of ""home sweet home,"" ""dream home,"" ""home is where the heart is,"" ""sweet home Alabama"" ""homeland,"" ""there's no place like home,"" and ""homies."" In the course, we will consider the home as a social context that profoundly shapes our personal and collective identities, gender roles and interpersonal relationships, class status and divisions, racial-ethnic memberships and conflicts, plus values and political ideals.

Sociology,SOCY,35,Sociology of Mental Health,"Poor mental health and mental illness are often viewed as biological flaws. Sociologists, however, argue that mental illness is socially constructed, and that population mental health is profoundly shaped by social conditions.

Is there really a “Protestant ethic” and a “spirit of capitalism?” Or is human prosperity completely independent of religious belief, institutions, and “spirit”? How do Western and non-Western societies seeking their place in the modern world reconcile religious traditions with the demands of economic globalization?

The course begins with a discussion of major theories of revolutions, including works that focus on class analysis, ideological conflicts, and the state. In the second half of the term, the course explores the revolutions in Iran, Nicaragua, and the Philippines, focusing on the causes of the conflicts, the revolutionary processes, and their alternative outcomes: Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, revolutionary socialism in Nicaragua, and the restoration of liberal democracy in the Philippines. The latter part of the course relies on documentary films that contain actual footages of the revolutionary struggles and their outcomes in the three countries.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-49-18
Sociology,SOCY,49.19,Sport and Democratization in the Ancient and Modern Worlds,"The relationship between democratization in society and in sports forms the subject matter of this course.  We will begin to explore that relationship by looking at the various ways in which democratization in society and in sports influence each other in the modern world.  Then we will turn our attention to the past and examine the relationship between democratization in society and in sports in sixth- and fifth-century BCE Greece, in nineteenth-century CE Britain, and in twentieth-century CE America.  The course will end with a consideration of the lessons we have learned about democratization in society and in sports for public policy in the United States and elsewhere.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-49-19

Sociology,SOCY,49.23,Critical Political Economy,"Political economy was formulated as a central field of research since the 19th century, designed to comprehend both fields - politics and economics - and how they interact, at the local, regional and global level. Since the 2008 financial crisis it became a very popular field of research, highlighting varied and opposed theoretical approaches. The course will focus on critical perspectives to political economy, including a. class conflict, race and ethnic relations and the world system; b. state institutions and their relation to civil society, capital and labor organizations; and c. late developments of the neoliberal economy, the social and economic implications of inequality, and global protests of the 99%.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-49-23

But while the declaration helped globalize human rights, the world continues to experience genocide, torture, slavery, discrimination, and the wide-scale displacement of people. The course seeks to gain a greater appreciation of the complex social forces that impede human rights while also imagining new strategies to address current-day human rights challenges. Students will critically examine human rights case law, develop a non-governmental organization, and participate in a simulation of the United Nations Security Council.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-49-24

Sociology,SOCY,51,Prisons: The American Way of Punishment,"Prison as a place of confinement, punishment and rehabilitation is the focus of this survey of the history, philosophies, structure and operation of corrections in the United States. The course critically examines the concept of prison as a total institution and its panopticism as a model of social control that extends to other social contexts. The course will explore the world of inmates and their strategies of subcultural adaptations to and resistance against incarceration; as well as the role of the prison staff. Particular attention will be paid to how gender, race, economics and politics structure prison policies and dynamics. Specific topics may include cultural representations of prison life, implications of current sentencing practices, privatization and the prison-industrial complex, incarcerated mothers, capital punishment, juvenile justice, and alternatives to incarceration. Open to all classes.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-51
Sociology,SOCY,53,"Power, Politics and the State","Is America in crisis? The nation is more deeply divided politically, economically, and ideologically than it has been for generations. Washington is in gridlock. Inequality and poverty have been rising. People have become polarized over racial, religious and social issues. Some say the politics of identity and self-interest have been unleashed at the expense of the nation’s general welfare. Some disagree. This course explores these issues. It examines how political, economic and ideological power has been mobilized recently in the United States and with what consequences, including the conservative shift in American politics, the 2008 financial crisis, the election of Donald Trump, and possibly the decline of the United States as the world’s superpower. The course draws on scholarly work in sociology, political science and economics.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-53
Sociology,SOCY,54,Chasing the (Causal) Dragon: Intermediate Quantitative Data Analysis for Sociologists,"Sociologists and other social scientists are often interested in understanding causal and dynamic social processes such as:
“How do the places we live, work, and play get under the skin and affect health and well-being across the life course?”
“Does upward social class mobility change one’s political attitudes?”
“What social currents are responsible for changes in support for same-sex marriage across historical time?” 
“Are long-standing racial inequalities declining, persisting, or increasing in recent years?”
Many of these questions are methodologically difficult to answer with observational (non-experimental) data, and they require that we get a handle on the study of change, context, and causality. You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists’ methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.
In this course, we’ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going “under the hood” and more focused on “how to drive”—specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals. The course will culminate in an independent research project where students will analyze data and use the one or more of the modeling techniques discussed during the term to answer a sociological research question of their choosing. SOCY 10 or equivalent and a basic understanding of STATA is required to enroll in this course.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-54
Sociology,SOCY,55,Poverty and Public Policy in the U.S.,More than one in ten Americans lives in poverty according to official statistics. This course explores the nature and extent of poverty in the United States and the role of the government in addressing poverty issues. How do we measure poverty? Why does poverty persist? Why is there so little political discourse about poverty in America today? How effective are various poverty alleviation programs?,http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-55
Sociology,SOCY,56,Sociology of Gender,"What is gender? This seminar examines multiple sociological perspectives on what it means to be a woman, man, boy, or girl in everyday life - including gender as a social structure, an identity, an ideology, and something people ""do."" Readings and discussions reflect a belief that diversity (race/ethnicity, class, age, sexuality, etc.) is central to the study of gender. Possible topics include: language, the body, science, the wage gap, education, and masculinity during young adulthood.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-56

Using sociological theories and methods, we will examine the structure of schools and their effects on individuals and society. We will explore both formal and informal education. This course will focus on inequalities, specifically how social class, race, gender, and sexuality both organize and are organized by educational environments.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-58
Sociology,SOCY,60,"Dangerous Intersections:  Race, Class and Gender","Race, class or gender have, to varying degrees, traditionally been employed within the academic disciplines as separate variables or distinct categories of analysis. Increasingly, however, there are calls for and attempts at understanding the relationships among systems of race/ethnicity, sex/gender and class differentiation. Through engaging both theoretical and empirical works, this course will examine the ways in which the simultaneous and interdependent dynamics between these systems shape identity formation and life changes, relationships of marginality and privilege, social continuity and social conflict. It will critically explore the challenges and advantages of intersectional analysis in such contexts as play and leisure, economic roles, sexuality, and law.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-60
Sociology,SOCY,61,Unstalling the Stalled Revolution: Gender (In)equality at Work and at Home,"The nature of work, family life, and gender relations has changed dramatically over the last half century. This course examines these trends, with a focus on implications for gender inequality in society. We will focus on patterns in paid labor force participation and family life in the United States, and discuss the major debates surrounding the causes and consequences of such trends. We will also pay attention to how these patterns look across different races, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status, as well as briefly examine how these trends compare to other countries. We will conclude by exploring the implication of gender inequality for families, as well as work-family policy debates.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-61
Sociology,SOCY,62,"Love, Romance, Intimacy and Dating","Why do you connect with some people and not others? What exactly is love? And how do you make smart romantic choices for yourself? In this course we examine the social aspects of love, romance, intimacy, and dating. Using sociological theories and methods, we will investigate how cultural beliefs and structural arrangements affect our most intimate feelings and experiences. Specific topics include virginity loss, adolescent sexual behavior, hooking up, dating, intimacy and polyamory.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-62
Sociology,SOCY,63,Trust in Society,"You trust your friend to repay the $10 you loaned her last week; investors trust the stock market to accurately value corporate resources; you trust members of your class work group to complete their parts of the group project; patients trust doctors to inform them about the best treatments; some people trust Uber but others trust taxi services; waitresses trust patrons to tip them for good service; many but not all citizens trust the government to enforce laws fairly.
The word trust appears as a verb in each of these examples, but do we really mean the same thing by trust in each of these very different situations?  What exactly is trust anyway, and why does it matter?  Social science and popular press literature of the past decade suggests that trust is the cause of many “good” things, such as the source of cooperation, the basis of democracy, the foundation of the market economy, the source of national economic power, the key, even, to morality.  Given its relation to all things good, it is not surprising that some commentators speak with alarm when they claim that “trust is declining” in society.
In this course we will explore the following questions: What is trust and what are its benefits? How is trust created? How is trust destroyed? Is trust declining in modern society? How would we know if it was?  We will read and discuss theoretical and empirical research on trust from sociology and from across the social sciences.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-63
Sociology,SOCY,64,The Sociology of Emotion,"Most people think of emotions as a purely internal experience, composed solely of physiological elements. Recently, however, sociologists have begun to emphasize and explore the social side of emotion-for example, how emotions are shaped socially and culturally, how emotions are socially controlled, and the consequences of emotion for social life. We will examine these and other sociological aspects of emotional experience in this course, including exploring current debates about the social functions of emotions, especially as they pertain to the substantive areas of work and family. Topics include the social causes of emotion; cultural variations in feeling and expression norms (especially in regard to love and anger); changes in American norms over time; the shaping of children's emotions through socialization; individual and social techniques of emotion management; the social distribution of emotional experience; the social functions of emotion; emotional deviance; and the individual and social consequences of emotional display.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-64
Sociology,SOCY,65,The Social Psychology of Inequality,"Sociological social psychology examines the relationship between individuals and the larger social systems in which they are embedded, including interactions, groups, institutions, and cultures. This course will use key social psychological concepts (e.g., status, power, stigma, justice, identity) to explore how inequality is created, reproduced, and resisted. We will study how inequality operates in different social and institutional contexts (e.g., work, family, schools), and for members of different social groups (e.g., race, class, gender, age).",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-65
Sociology,SOCY,66,Markets and Management,"What is money? How do people find jobs? Are markets competitive or cooperative? This course examines these and other questions about how economic behavior is organized, operates and changes historically. It recognizes that economic activity is socially organized and guided by political, cultural and normative as well as economic principles. It explores how economic activity takes many forms, including groups of small competitive firms, large and powerful corporations, and diffuse networks of companies tied together through inter-firm alliances, business associations and other sorts of cooperative and competitive relations with each other, unions, government agencies and universities. It examines the organization and operation of different kinds of markets, different theories of how economic activity is organized, and the social factors that contribute to economic success or failure. It also investigates how managers, unions, policy makers and governments are coping with recent economic challenges, such as those posed by technological change and the globalization of economic activity.

This course examines health systems across developed and developing nations. Comparisons will be made in terms of: (a) population health, (b) health care organization, (c) health care financing, (d) health professionals and their patients, and (e) health system performance and reform strategies. Understanding how health care is delivered around the world will lead to a better understanding of the relative merits and limitations of various systems.

But how extensive has the trend toward ""globalization"" been? Is it really a new phenomenon? Has globalization changed societies? If so, how? If not, why not? Are societies becoming more alike because they experience common globalization pressures or do they retain their unique national characteristics? This course examines these questions and more. Specifically, we will look at how globalization has affected business, states, labor movements, social inequality, social welfare, citizenship rights, the environment, culture, national security, and other aspects of society.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-69

How has science shaped our understanding of race and human diversity? This course explores how and why race is a social construction with profound implications in our social world not only in the U.S. but also beyond its shores. Diverse sciences have established that human beings are well over 99% genetically identical, but race remains a potent vision through division that has been made and made to matter across multiple spheres of life. This ranges from ancestry testing to our identities to how we are categorized to where we live and whom we are taught to love and hate in society. How race intersects with socio-economic disparities related to inclusion and exclusion are among the topics examined in this course.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-71

Sociology,SOCY,79.09,79.09 Global Inequality Protests,"Three years after the 2008 financial crisis a protest movement sparked in Tunisia, and expanded by contagion to Egypt, Morocco and India, and from there to Spain, Chile, Israel, and finally arrived to Wall Street, giving the name to the global movement as the Occupy social movement. These cases largely differ from one another, but have in common their opposition to inequality and readiness to struggle against it. The course will focus on the comparison of protest movements and the political processes each case provoked, using theories of social movements and political sociology, and analyzing the economic, social and political context before the protests sparked and the after movements' peaks. We will analyze and discuss in class the Occupy Wall Street movement and the political process it provoked in the US. Each student will chose an international case for comparison, presenting it in class and writing a research paper of their own as a final essay.

Sociology,SOCY,79.11,Nationalism and the Radical Right,"This course will introduce you to recent social science contributions to the subject of neo-nationalism and radical right-wing activism. Beginning with terminology, historical context and methodological approaches, we will proceed to an analysis of recent socio-political developments, focusing on the interrelationship between radical right-wing activism and other social phenomena. We will interrogate the reasons behind the appeal of the far right, inquiring into various socio-economic contexts, the role of historical narratives in shaping far-right activism, and the “mainstreaming” of far-right ideas. An overarching question for all these discussions will be that of the agency and motivations of the actors involved.
We will draw cases from numerous contexts around the world and will reflect on similar developments on the political left. The course will allow for discussion of the most recent developments, as experienced by class attendees and reported by mass media. Finally, we will discuss ethical aspects of studying right-wing (and, for that matter, any political) radicalism.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Sociology/SOCY-Sociology/SOCY-79-11

As we venture into the 21st century, various issues of class, race and gender inequalities and conflicts appear to dominate popular discourse and policy debates. This capstone seminar will explore current substantive and theoretical expressions of the sociological imagination for providing critical assistance in understanding some of the major social issues of our time. The seminar is designed to emphasize critical discussion through active participation and class presentations.

By exploring literary works, engravings, photographs, and films, this course intends to concentrate on the erotic nature of a number of Spanish cultural works starting from the 18th to the mid-20th century in which the obscene, the pornographic and the erotic serve as platform to discuss other issues such as gender politics, gendered relations, Iberian humor, social marginalization, race, identity, and the concept of Spanishness.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-50-04

The image of the slaughterhouse for a society can be used to define, contrast, compare or put into question our own subjectivity for it highlights the flesh and blood that go into human labor At the same time, the image of the slaughterhouse denounces the abusive nature of power, a regulating force applied to bodies, both human and non-human. Using the image of the slaughterhouse in texts and images spanning 250 years of Southern cone history, we will explore various issues and debates within animal studies, from animal rights and biopolitics to modernization of killing, exploitation of bodies and zones of indetermination between animals and humans. Texts and images include: Echeverría, Lamborghini, Viñas, Walsh, Larra, Kohan, Busqued, Solanas, Sanjines, Foucault, Deleuze, Agamben and Giorgi.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-55-06

It may be hard to imagine that there were multiple forms of rebellion and revolution under Absolutism in early modern Europe. But that is of course a prejudice from our modern times that need to be debunked in light of social attitudes towards power documented during that time period. We will explore salient cases from political revolution to subtle resistance in early modern texts and images of Spain and Spanish America. We will unearth impactful political upheavals as well as individual and collective forms of resistance relating gender, race, religion, etc., and forms of anti-establishment sentiment that occurred more often than we could imagine.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-55-09

Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures,SPAN,63.09,"Beyond Sex, Drugs, and Rock ‘n Roll: Radical Latinxs in the 60’s","The 1960s and 70s were a time of tremendous political and creative turmoil in the US in general and for Latinos in particular. Joining in the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-Vietnam mobilization, Latinos also fought for their rights founding important political organizations such as the Raza Unida Party; MeCHA, the United Farm Workers, the Brown Berets, the Nuyorican Young Lords Party, among many others. Beyond traditional stereotypes of the 60s as the period of drugs, sex and rock ‘n roll, protesters and political activists were inordinately adept at creating and mobilizing artistic symbols, music, and literature to promote their agenda. We will study the creation of Aztlán as an imaginary Chicano homeland in the Southwest; works of individual Latino artists and writers; important journals (Con Safos, Chismearte, Arte del Varrio); organizations such as the Royal Chicano Air Force, Asco, Galería de la Raza, the Teatro Campesino, the Nuyorican Poets’ Café; national monuments such as Chicano Park; and exhibitions such as Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA; held at UCLA).

Almodóvar's filmmaking, both in aesthetic and cultural terms, addresses issues which will appeal to students interested in understanding how culture, politics, and aesthetics get entangled in ways that “queer” gender identity, family structures, notions of community and the societal expectations and limitations surrounding them. The course will also compare his work with other contemporary filmmakers that have reconfigured in their films the boundaries of “family.”",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-63-10
Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures,SPAN,65.12,"Reading Spain with Goya, the Eternal Provocateur","Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) lived in a period of intense political upheaval, civil wars and social turmoil. His early work showed the influence of the Enlightenment and had a critical point of view that aimed to not only please but also educate his viewers. As time went by, the ravages of illness, war, and political repression showed in his paintings through impactful and enigmatic imagery that upended the traditional role of an artist and that has earned him a relevant place in contemporary Spanish culture, as shown in his numerous films that bring him alive. Although he became a court painter and was well connected to the monarchy, a closer look to his paintings reveals a critical stance that urges his viewers to reflect on the lack of meaning in modern society. From the royal tapestries and portraits, to the incisive Caprichos, the impactful Disasters of the War and the desperate Black Paintings, we will examine the history of Spain through Goya's major works, not only as subject but also as object of representation in literature and in films.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-65-12

Taking as point of departure both the comic and the romantic interpretations, the course will explore the meaning of the Quijote across the centuries. Its aim will be to understand the Quijote both as an autonomous work of literature and as a highly creative response to the literary and cultural forces from which it was forged. In addition to the historical context and social conflicts in the Hapsburg monarchy, the course will focus on the literary history and the novel as a literary genre and a product of the Medieval “mixtification” which flourished in the Renaissance.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-70-01
Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures,SPAN,70.02,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Few literary works have ever fascinated readers all over the world the way One Hundred Years of Solitude has. Gabriel García Márquez’s novel opens up a magical world where the boundaries that separate fantasy and reality, fairy tale and history seem to dissolve naturally. And yet, no fictional work has ever been more deeply grounded in the reality and history of a people. The book tells the incredible story of the Buendía family as it develops through the successive cycles of destruction and rebirth that shape history in the mythical world of Macondo. As the story unfolds it illuminates the wonders and terrors of the history of Latin American countries, the complexities and contradictions that have defined their peoples, and shaped their cultures. In this course we will read enjoy and analyze One Hundred Years of Solitude as well as a selection of García Márquez’s short stories and journalistic works.

Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures,SPAN,80.21,The Boricua Gaze: Decolonialism in Puerto Rican Visual Cultures,"Puerto Rican artists, filmmakers, writers, and performers have used the critical and subversive power of visuality to decolonize cultural production. As early as the 18th and 19th centuries, painters such as José Campeche and Francisco Oller appropriated European traditions to imagine and depict Puerto Rican cultural autochthony. Twentieth and twenty-first century artists have radicalized their works to question the legitimacy of artistic institutions and the capitalist logic of the art market. Film, photography, media, literature, theater, and performance also deploy the decolonizing Boricua Gaze to shed light on Puerto Rico’s colonial condition, while muralism, parades, and public street festivals in the Puerto Rican enclaves of the US serve as visual forms of resistance against gentrification, political corruption, and the violent policing of brown and black bodies. Students in this senior seminar will engage with a broad repertoire of artistic and material practices in order to produce interdisciplinary scholarship that reflects the historical, social, and political dimensions of Puerto Rican visual cultures.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Spanish-and-Portuguese-Languages-and-Literatures/SPAN-Spanish/SPAN-80-21

Theater,THEA,36,The Speaking Voice for the Stage,"This course is an examination of the principles and practice of freeing the natural voice. It proceeds from the notion that ""voice"" and ""acting"" are inseparable. Although it is an introduction to the use of voice in the theater, it is in no way limited to the actor. A specific progression of exercises will be presented to facilitate freeing the body of tensions, discovering the natural breath, releasing vibrations of sound from the body, and opening the channel for sound (throat, jaw, tongue). Resonance, vocal freedom, and articulation will also be explored. Techniques for accessing emotional and psychological truth will be practiced as fundamental to the actor's creative process. A groundwork will be laid for physical and vocal presence. Each student will be responsible for the development and practice of a vocal warm-up. A variety of speaking assignments will be made to develop confidence, presence, and emotional expressivity. Text materials utilized will emerge from self-scripted autobiographical storytelling. A strong commitment to the work is necessary to explore what it means to find one's voice.

Race, migration, and sexuality are experienced differentially across all groups and individuals. They also have distinctive transnational and diasporic histories and practices. This course will focus on the various groups that have comprised the United States in a comparative and decolonial study aligned with the intersectional approach advocated by black feminists. Students will learn about issues of race, migration, and sexuality across time and space, as critical dimensions of the nation’s political and economic structures, within different ethnocultural traditions, and in aesthetic, performance practices. The central object is to weave diverse historical and cultural traditions into a larger synthesis of the meaning of race, migration and sexuality in North American life that is deftly attuned to power in all of its guises and establishmentarian logics.
As a broad introduction to the multi- and inter-disciplinary studies in race, migration, and sexuality, the course will employ “a constellated approach” that will highlight the connections between our interdisciplinary programs with components of study in U.S. ethnicities, genders and indigeneities. It will enable students to think across the fields of Latinx, African, Native and Asian American Studies while also encouraging thinking in global, hemispheric, transnational and decolonial terms.

In doing so, we will situate the histories and social worlds of the region in a global frame, asking how global political and economic transformations have affected the region. At the same time that we attend closely to these histories, we will also examine the ways in which the category of “woman” has been mobilized in popular and political discourses in the 18th-21th centuries, paying particular attention to how Muslim and Middle Eastern women have been represented in various political discourses, as well as how they have represented themselves. Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-24-02

Therefore, we will pay close attention to the issue of power - in terms of control and distribution of resources and the enforcement of gender roles and sexuality. We will also look at how Western gender ideals have been imposed on people in other parts of the world.

It also considers how theories of racial justice might better include the concerns of women of color as well as LGBT and trans persons of color.

How does Black women’s activism constitute a political intellectual tradition that impacts how we do research and pose questions? How does black women’s activism refigure the categories and categorization of knowledge and knowledge production? What does it mean to write oneself into existence if and when knowledge is premised on their epistemic and actual disappearance? This course approaches Black women’s intellectual and cultural production as one entry point into the project of creating from nothing, writing to become, writing as an act of survival, and writing to envision and practice new worlds.

This course challenges what we dominantly understand as activism—key to the emergence of feminist and queer theory and ethnic studies. Moving away from political actions centered in these disciplines, such as strikes, protests, and boycotts, this course will turn to visual and performance art works by artists of color, who consider other forms of action that are not overtly visible, resistant, oppositional, agentive, militant, loud, and documentable. Each week, students will examine a performance at the limit of action, including passivity, silence, and endurance, alongside issues related to gender, sexuality, labor, and immigration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer theory, critical ethnic studies, Asian American Studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-40-05

This course offers an opportunity to explore how past histories of domination continue to emanate into the present. Through the lens of feminist and queer of color performance, we will engage a diverse array of aesthetic forms—including performance and installation art, literature, poetry, film, music, and new media— in order to learn how cultural practitioners use the arts to sustain life in a world framed by overlapping legacies of white supremacy, colonialism, capitalism, and heteropatriarchy. Our readings and materials will be interdisciplinary, spanning gender and queer studies, critical ethnic studies, American studies, and performance studies. Traversing 20th and 21st century cultural production, each week will be organized around artists and writers who actively engage the concept of memory as a political act against the denial or disavowal of violence. We set out to understand the social, political, and economic contexts in which artists create their work, addressing issues of race, gender, sexuality, nation, class, ability, and environmental decay. In doing so, we come to more intimately know how performances of time, memory, and trauma include a fervent belief in the potential of queer and feminist possibility.

We will explore similarities and differences in women's experiences and feminist methodologies across global Muslim contexts.

"Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program",WGSS,41.06,Transnational Feminisms,"Transnational feminism, in its broadest vision, has been the project of “feminism without borders.” Rooted in intersectionality, justice, praxis, and solidarity, the banner of transnational feminism has assembled scholars and activists from diverse social and geopolitical positions through coalitions across global, regional, national, and local borders, both within and beyond the nation-state. This course begins with genealogies of global, women of color, and postcolonial or Third World feminisms and histories of movement-building from which transnational feminism emerged. Students will be introduced to themes of universalism, solidarity, positionality, and the problems with  speaking for “others,” especially Northern feminists representing women in the Global South. In the second part of the course, we turn to contemporary topics in transnational feminism, including globalization, development, war, militarism, labor, migration, climate change, and humanitarianism, and feminist mobilizing against injustice within and across borders.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-41-06

Yet the meaning of violence is seldom analyzed. Using an ethnographic lens, this course explores violence as both an embodied experience and a socially and culturally mediated event. We examine spectacular and everyday forms of violence in terms of manifestations of power, structures of inequality, perceptions of difference, and politics of representation. Ethnographic studies are drawn from, among others, Mozambique, Haiti, and Harlem. An introduction to the cultural anthropology of violence, this course raises key quesitons about violence in a globalized world and explores how to study it anthropologically.

Did virgins get to heaven faster than those who marry? Can a chaste man and woman live together without succumbing to lust? Were men holier than women? What about women who behaved like men?

Yet the course is called ""Women and the Bible,"" not ""Women in the Bible,"" and implicit in this title is a second goal of the course: not only to look at the Bible to see what it actually says about women but also to look at differing ways that modern feminist biblical scholars have engaged in the enterprise of interpreting the biblical text.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-43-03

After examining different conceptions of the human body in traditional China, we will focus on sexual practices advocated by the traditions of immortality seekers, Daoism, and esoteric Buddhism as ways to enlightenment and transcendence. In our explorations we will look at the earliest records of sexual practices found in tombs of the 3rd century B.C.E. and examine Daoist sexual initiation rites and secret rites practiced by emperors. We will consider how notions of cosmic powers and forces are expressed in sexual rituals and how society views such practices. We will also compare Chinese notions of the body and of sexual practices with those found in West.

We will make critical study of the constructions of gender, femininity, masculinity, sexuality, gender relations, marriage and divorce in classical and modern Islamic texts. In asking how Islamic notions of gender are constructed, we will examine both the roles religious texts have played in shaping Muslim life and how Muslim life in its cultural diversity affects readings of religious texts. We will read works of Muslim thought on gender relations in their historical contexts and in relation to one another. Through in-class discussions, critical reading exercises, and short essay assignments, students will strengthen their literacy on global gender issues, study religio-historical ideas on gender, analyze the role of texts in shaping gender in society, and vice versa.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-43-06

We will begin in ancient India by examining the founding of the Order of Nuns; the monastic lives, spiritual poetry, and struggles of early Buddhist nuns; and the decline and death of the nuns’ order in India. Then we’ll move on to explore a wide range of topics from throughout the Buddhist world—such as the economic and political power of the nuns’ order in parts of East Asia; the death of the nuns’ order and the phenomenon of low-status “unofficial” nuns throughout much of Southeast Asia; the power of yoginis and other non-monastic spiritual roles for women in Tibet; the increasing phenomenon of Western nuns; and the feminist possibilities (or impossibilities) inherent in Buddhist doctrine.

Taking our cue from Adrienne Rich, who ambiguously titles one book of essays On Lies, Secrets and Silences (is she for or against?), we will follow debates about what makes it possible to break previous silences--and to what degree and in what ways it is useful or satisfying to do so. Topics within this discussion will include sexuality, race, illness, literary modes, female literary succession, and relations with the literary tradition. We will read in the work of eight or nine poets and recent critical and theoretical writings, with some attention in the first weeks to important female and male precursors.

Women writers of this time were keen observers of the social codes that formed—and constrained—their identities. Though women wrote in many genres in this period, this course will focus on major novels of the nineteenth century because of the particular strategies female novelists used to open up hard questions about social identity, and particularly social possibilities for women. Questions about gender clearly implicate sexuality, class, ethnicity, race, and power, as well, in complex, compelling, and unexpected ways. We will read works by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Emily Brontë, Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot, and we will end the class by reading substantial excerpts from the private, unpublished diaries of the women writers who published as “Michael Field.”",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-48-09

"Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program",WGSS,51.07,Memoirs and the Work They Do,"Memoir has been a popular genre in the United States, Latin America and Europe for at least the last twenty years. That popularity does not seem to be abating, despite critics’ claims that most recent memoirs are shallow, repetitive and badly written.  In this course we will review some of the history of life writing forms to parse out misogyny and elitism.  We will also learn how experts today understand life writing subgenres in print and other media, paying particular attention to experimentation and the line between fiction and non-fiction.  The focus of the course concerns how life writing is deployed in creating group identities, related to everything from addiction to victimhood, sexuality, ethnicity, and nationality.  Texts include Coetzee's Boyhood,  Spiegelman's Maus, Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home, Kacandes's Daddy's War, Modiano's Dora Bruder, Cho’s I’m the One that I Want, and Consalvi's Broadcasting the Civil War in El Salvador. Students will be asked to interview another about her or his life, do some writing about their own lives and bring examples to bear on our various topics from other cultures and languages than those represented on the syllabus.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-51-07

While the course will begin with a brief consideration of the conventions and early history of the genre, most of the course will examine post-1970s (most American) young adult novels. We'll trave the evolution of the genre in relation to ideas of racial innocence, sentimentality, consent, queer childhood, and revolutionary girlhood, and position the novels within historical contexts such as the rise of mass incarceration, settler colonialism, fantasies of post-racial politics, and environmental disaster. At the end of the course, we'll consider how young adult novels have created not just reading but creative communities and explore the kinds of fan productions that have emerged in relation to young adult novels. The course will include critical and creative assignments. Texts may include The Hunger Games; the Harry Potter series; Are You There God, It's Me Margaret; The Outsiders; The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing; Vivian Apple at the End of the World; Fangirl; Artistotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe; Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian; The Fault in Our Stars; Ship Breaker; Long Division; Monster; Akata Witch; Make Your Home Among Strangers.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-51-09

How does one shed light and offer insight on the other? How might the “bad” and the “queer” name the refusal and failure to assimilate and align oneself with racial capital, settler colonial logics, and reproductive futurity? How might both terms require us to rethink what narratives of belonging look, feel, and sound like and in turn, become the grounds for alternative solidarities, affiliations, and intimacies across lines of minority difference? To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility. Through these works, we will address historical processes of Asian/American racial, gender, and sexual formation by way of the “bad” and the “queer,” as transformative political and aesthetic categories of inquiry that risk failing to fit in, being wrong, and not belonging.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-51-10

The contexts of the colonial encounter and its postcolonial aftermath will set the stage for our examination of the ways in which social, political, economic, and cultural factors foster the production of specific masculinities. Texts include Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Lafferiere’s How to Make Love to a Negro, and additional writings by Irish, Indian, and Australian authors. Our study will be organized around the questions of the production of hegemonic and subaltern masculinities, the representation of the colonial and postcolonial male body, the militarization of masculinity, and the relation between masculinity and nationalism.

This course explores that tradition of cultural activism considering attempts to narrate revolutionary formation, imagine solidarity, and write decolonial history. We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas—ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature—in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners. We will pay special attention to the work of feminist and queer solidarity artists, writers, and performers. Finally, we will examine contemporary activist cultural projects, such as PanAmerican public art road trips and hashtag-activism.

We come to these relationships with preconceptions, often created primarily from our encounters with others that are mediated through language. In this course, we will examine how knowledge is constructed through language using India as a case study. This course is directly related to Dartmouth’s program in Hyderabad, India. Our focus will be on the representation of women and female agency in this case study of India as we explore how knowledge is created, by whom, and to what ends. Language is a powerful instrument. We will analyze how language has been and is currently used to portray India, as we will think critically about how our perceptions of India have been shaped by what we have read, heard, and seen. Some questions we will address are: How have images of India been constructed over time? To what ends? What impact has colonialism had on how India was portrayed to the west? How did/do Indian writers use language to reclaim their country? How is feminism defined in India? How can we understand female agency in the Indian context?

Drawing on archival research, critical theory and speculative fiction from Black queer and trans thinkers such as Miss Major, Edouard Glissant, Marie Vieux-Chauvet, Octavia Butler, and Samuel Delany, our goal will be to challenge our current carceral order, chart how we move past it, and imagine what liberatory prison abolitionist futures lie beyond.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-52-06

Often it seems to bypass the love-object altogether, and focuses instead on power relations or poetic achievement. Beginning with early examples, and moving on to contemporary and modern poems, our course will place love poems by men and women in the context of an ongoing poetic tradition, recent feminist criticism and theory, and talk about love and sex in recent popular culture. This last will include: excerpts from recent books about dating and seduction, film, contemporary song lyrics, dating websites, and campus culture.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-53-05

This course will examine the historic influence of women on the field of journalism, from Nellie Bly's turn-of-the-century undercover exposes to today's newsroom professionals. How has the growing number of women journalists affected the coverage of women's issues such as welfare, abortion, and health crises such as breast cancer? How do women deal with ""objectivity"" in covering these issues? We will look at new styles in literary journalism pioneered by women, notably Frances Fitzgerald on Vietnam, Joan Didion on cultural issues in 60s and 70s, Oriana Fallaci on world leaders, and Sheryl WuDunn on China. We will analyze the work of women columnists who have changed the face of political discourse in the U.S., and examine the historical contributions of muckrakers like Ida Tarbell and anti-lynching crusader Ida B.

Today’s “Datafication” is a process of transforming diverse processes, qualities, actions and phenomena into forms that are machine-readable by digital technologies, but the act of turning humans and human bodies into quanta of information has a long history. We will be using art, new media, history, information science, and more to think through the impact that datafication has on how we understand ourselves and others. Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which data has historically been used in racializing and gendering ways, and the role that quantification of people has been integral to the development of the Western nation-state.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-57-01

We will investigate gendered notions of genius, creativity and originality, including the status of women artists as “exceptional.” Looking also at the female nude in Western art and feminist art in post-modernism, we will analyze the roles that femininity and masculinity play in modernism. With a focus mostly on the 18th-20th c., major figures include Artemisia Gentileschi and Judith Leyster, Mme de Pompadour, Elisabeth Vigée-LeBrun, Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, Frida Kahlo, Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman, among others.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-58-05

Yet other issues have arisen with the commercialization and globalization of reproduction: Is there anything wrong with selling one’s reproductive labor? Is it ethical to ‘outsource’ pregnancy to Indian surrogates? We will start by looking backward to ethical issues around the introduction of contraception; we will end by looking forward, to the promise of same-sex reproduction through in vitro-gametogenesis, and reproduction via artificial gestation.  While we will consider numerous perspectives on each issue, special consideration will be given to feminist viewpoints.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-61-06
"Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program",WGSS,62.02,A Global History of Sexual Science,"This course provides an introduction to the global history of sexual science from the late 19th Century through the mid-20th Century.  The beginnings of scientific approaches to sex, gender and sexuality were very diverse and thus we will read—among others—historical medical, psychiatric, anthropological, journalistic, philosophical and literary texts.  Scientific notions of sexuality did not simply migrate from the “West” to the “rest,” but developed as a result of complex, mutually constitutive interactions and global networks.  The field of sexual science emerged not just in Europe and North America but in a variety of places, such as India, Chile, or China.  Its proponents in different parts of the world were intensely aware of each other and interacted through publications, conferences, or travel. Moreover, proponents of sexual science in Europe and North America adopted notions forged in exchange with actors in Asia, Latin America and Africa, e.g., the US practice of gender reassignment surgery was heavily influenced by earlier Mexican cases or the German legal understanding of homosexuality was tested and contested in its colonial African courts.  We will study many figures who have been forgotten in contemporary work on sexuality or sexual science.  Some of these figures drew from the repressive legal, social and cultural discourses that limited sexual expression and gave the ideological grounds to discrimination and persecution.  But others—and they were at times the very same figures—connected to the liberating discourses, the power of which we are experiencing today.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-62-02

We will read primary texts in the anatomical, astronomical, mathematical, and physical sciences, along with contemporary theory on gender, science, and Anglo-American cultures. Please note that the construction of the gender binary and notions of biological race are very much at the fore of this course but are not taken as a ‘natural,’ given, or stable quality. The history of science is HUGE, so we’ll take two areas as focal points for the course: bodies as sites of knowledge and mathematical sciences.",http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies-Program/WGSS-Womens-Gender-and-Sexualities-Studies/WGSS-62-04

The subjects are mostly moving images (cinema, TV and video), activist performances and some aspects of visual art. The starting-point is the simultaneous 'invention', disease mongering (pathologization) and 'emancipation' of homosexuality in the European fin de siècle and how it is negotiated in educational and feature films. The syllabus moves then to figurations of queerness in popular (and queer) imagination, for instance the 'Drag Queen' or the 'Vampire' with special attention on the AIDS crisis and will finally focus on gender-ambivalence, transgender, and gender-bending performances such Butch-Femme aesthetic or Glam-Rock.

Our focus on the quotidian and staged experiences of those who identify or are identified as an outsider, misfit, or the Other is an invitation to intensively analyze and perform what it means to be at once queer and gendered, queer of color, and queer and wild. From accents and affects to styling and production, we will read a range of manifestos, performances, literature, and art that conform to and yet also deviate from what is normal or acceptable in mainstream, U.S-American society. The key words in the title, ""Of Color, Wildness and Fabulosity,"" are suggestive of alternative queer practices in the U.S. and around the world that engage, exceed or even explode dominant categories of race, gender and sexuality.

We will look at conceptions of queerness that play with hyperbolic genders, sexualities and racializations, and interrogate their value, significance and meaning as cultural and/or political expressions.

Institute for Writing and Rhetoric,WRIT,3,Composition and Research: II,"This two-term course in first-year composition works on the assumption that excellence in writing arises from serious intellectual engagement. To achieve this excellence, WRIT 2 - WRIT 3 enrolls students into intensive, seminar-style classes in which literary and other works (including the students' own) are read closely, with attention to substance, structure, and style. The primary goal of WRIT 2 is for students to learn to write clearly and with authority. By submitting themselves to the rigorous process of writing, discussing, and rewriting their papers, students come to identify and then to master the essential properties of the academic argument.  In WRIT 3, students engage in the more sustained discourse of the research paper. These papers are not restricted to literary criticism but might employ the research protocol of other academic disciplines. Throughout the reading, writing, and research processes, students meet regularly with their teaching assistants and professors, who provide them with individualized assistance.  Note: Writing 2-3 is taken in place of Writing 5. Students must complete both terms of Writing 2-3 and a First-year Seminar to fulfill the first-year writing requirement. Students who take the WRIT 2 - WRIT 3 sequence defer their First-year Seminar until the spring term.
